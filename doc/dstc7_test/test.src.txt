I hope they don't mess with it more.. it's finally working again on firefox
Yeah, I'm happy that at least ff works. But Opera's been broken ever since the breakage began. :(
it uses the same plugin?
you need to look at /var/logs/X11/[URL]mething.log
basically, i was being careless.  what do I find in there? I looked but wasn't sure what to look for
sorry. /var/log/[URL]mething.log. you want to look for some kind of Error. Fatal's are good ;)
okay. on the startup, i found an error. i think it was saying it failed to load hw_random. something like that
paste in #flood
called it Fatal
nice.
, let me get that.  i'm sending it in #flood.  did you see what i posted?
yep. looking at it
k
hrm im not sure how to help you with that one.
yes. whats the issue?
I got single disk to work but I have multiple disks
??
what mobo are you using btw?
does anyone else here run nvidia SLI on their machines?
ok, ignore me. and yes, i do.
I am running an Asus M2N-SLI deluxe edition with dual nvidia 8600GT (256MG DDR3)
oh, sorry.
I wasn't ignoring you, lol, I was just typing.. and I'm kinda slow at it lol
i know my bad, i apologise. errr... iirc the M2N range had a few problems with the bios mem?
I have 4GB of DDR2 RAM also.. with the AMD 6400+ proc @ 3.2GHz... I am trying to figure out why SLI won't work and why my dual 500GB hadd's keep giving me errors on bootup.  if that's the case, should I try a bios update then?
please do
I am now kinda gunshy at it since I fried my Gigabyte mobo by trying to flash it lol
hang in here for a sec..  back ;)
I know that the Asus has an EZ Flash 2 flash setup, but still, I am REALLY kinda scared, heh...
pftt.  just go for it imo
I probly will be, as soon as I can get it installed and grab what I need first. I think it's installing ok this time... I hope......
my VPN from home to work is playing up. bear with me.
you don't want to add debian to your [URL]st
try text in kernel option.  or reinstall grub from live cd
Well the thing is  sometimes when even trying to get into Recovery Mode it hangs after loading the CDRom Drive and shows ANSI: 05. ?
so use text mode (no x), you can pretty much fix all from console, press e in grub and add text option. if it fails try live cd
Where do I add the text option ?. remove quiet and splash?. Put text?
in kernel line, instead of quiet splash
k
what do you mean sometimes?
Well in recovery mode it sometimes boots in and sometimes doesn't and gets stuck.. I added the text option and now it's asking for login and password. I know my pass -.-, but have no idea what it wants for the login..
i suspect your username
=-p. I tried it.. There we go.. Now it's just sitting at "primedeath@primedeath-linux:~$
check logs (/var/log) and try... dpkg. what is command to fix X? reconfigure what?
"Gtk-warning". Cannot opend display..  Excuse my complete ignorance.
for what command?.  one is sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg, but before try xinit -- :1 vt7, search for broken instalations and kernel and system logs should show whats wrong
I did the recovery mode to fix broken packages, all were fine..  xinit -- :1 vt7 took me to a very tiny looking shell in the upper left of the screen.. I cannot input commands.
move mouse to it...
I cimoment. moment*. SOrry, back . Should I do the dpkg thing now?
try startx.  in this small terminal.  you under gnome, are you?
xinit : no such file or directory (errno 2) unable to connect to X server. No such process (errno 3) Serve Error. Server*. Aye, GNOME
install gdm, but first from those small, white terminall run for examplae nautilus
Okay, Nautilus worked.. Started with errors though... "gconf_value_free: Assertion ` value != Null ' faled
startx should also work in same way, if not try sudo apt-get install gdm
Okay, I'll have to restart unless you know another way to get another terminal going. It's stuck showing Nautilus errors at the moment.
Alt Ctrl F2 or F3
Nothin'
ups.. is Caps Lock still working?
? Huh? Caps lock works fine but has no use, heh.
can u hover with mouse terminal and press Ctrl-Z
Oh neat
?
I do apt-get install gdm but just says it's already the newest version
if you killed nautilus try startx.  if not kill %1
Magic. It started now..  It started but I hope it'll work upon reboot.
check logs first. for sure u need to reinstall something ro remove, you can use same method or change grub option.
which log file do I look at?
check your drivers if any and run apt-get with self check optons
The only driver I use that's third party is ATI's.
what can be problem also services in your sytem (start up stuff), remove all you do not need... and upgrade.
excuse my ignorance once again. Where are the startup items located?.  It's to the point where I won't find out what exactly went wrong. I think I am going to format the ext4 partition and reinstall. Going to mvoe all my files to my NTFS partition (setup files) and start again. I know I should learn how to fix this at the moment. I just don't have the time.
dont give up ;) or remove X (and gnome) to have more fun
LOL. I am a student and I just need my OS to work so i can continue to study!. So, blech!. Haha... Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't shy away from this if ti was any other day.
what version are you using? 10.04?
which history? firefox?
no, terminal history
open nautilus and browse to /home/yourusername press ctrl+h to show hidden files is there a file called .bash_history there?
yes, there is a .bash_history file there
right click that file choose properties>permissions is it set to read write and your user name in owner and gropup. group
did you read the mail server manual like I suggested?. pureadmin is a gtk gui
How did you intstall the fglrx driver ?
software & updates --> Addition Drivers and it looks like I have fglrx-updates
ajulmira: Additional drivers is pretty smart, but, what retruns from terminal command -> lspci -nnk | grep -iA3 vga <- (maybe no longer supported card ?)
that really depends on how you've got your drive set up, and how big it is.
thanks... i've got a 300 GB 2nd drive just installed ubuntu onto, gave it the whole drive
then / and /home are on the same ~300 GB partition, so it doesn't matter if you're installing them for your user into /home/username or as root
what's a software that shows a graphical use of the mount points? i'll load that and let you know,
Accessories > Disk Usage Analyzer.  but if you let ubuntu take the whole drive, you should only have one mount point at /
so / and /home, ok, nodidng... running Disk Usage Analyser on filesystem, really cool! :). uh, oh... / reports 100%, usr 80.6 % /var 12.7 %
that doesn't mean % full, just % of total
can i check the mount point with that utility also? or another one?
which mount point?
hope i'm asking intellingent questions.... well, you said just / should be mounted, not / and /home i took it to mean?
nono. what I'm saying is that your /home directory is on the same partition as every other directory, so you'd be using the same space whether you installed as your user or as root
well, ok, now i'm scanning 'home' and it shows that my download and desktop and music are only going to be 4.0 kb. ok, i understand you
sometimes / and /home are on different partitions, or different drives, and then what i said above are not necessarily the case
thank you. so all is ok, but when I install Ardour for instance, as i just did, which directory did that go to, as default
sure thing. the only other thing i'd recommend is that, if you're installing programs that exist in the ubuntu repositories, use the ones in the ubuntu repositories and install using apt-get, aptitude, or synaptic.  depends, how did you install it?.  (installing with the ubuntu software center is fine, too)
ahhh, good info, thanks  i installed from my login  that i created at the installation process time, and i used Ubuntu Software Package. i've used synaptic, ok. in the past I've used synaptic, so Ubuntu Software install is oktoo ?
okay, good, that's how you should install things :) when you install using any of those tools, the files are scattered in a few different places, depending on what they are. user binaries go to /usr/bin, libraries to /usr/lib, some extra stuff to /usr/share, ...
you might want to look into squid cache
define "get"?.  your NATing device should not matter at all as long as it can route IPv6.  however, you still need your ISP to allocate you an IPv6 address (or a block of addresses :))
maybe the router or router config?.  reboot the router??
it will use some tv tuners, yes
soooo many new things to learn. lol. i used to date a girl from kaunas. brb hafta reboot
!hi
ok....do i have to run nvidia-settings from root to get the settings to stick?
well, yes.. then you have to save them.
indy how do i run it from root?
gksudo nvidia-settings
why not you mount manually?
its got nothing to do w mounting, its a UPS
aha! I thought it's a usb disk.  /var/log/messages shows nothing when you plug it?
its plugged into a server far, far away...
you can't access that server via ssh?
don't use it
pidof firefox
jrib: returns nothing.  returns nothing
ps e | grep firefox
go to system>administration>network-rightclick - add launcher to desktop
that kind of thing works surprisingly well in some cases. Trouble starts mostly when X starts.
soudray: yeah wlell i got his ubuntu on a p4, i wnna put this hardrive into a computer with an amd
p4/amd won't be a problem
basically, i got another computer but don't wanna reinstall and reconfigure everything
it's worth a try.
just tell it to hold the package
for a start, there's no /; in that line
probably just a typo in there.
does it look logical?
frank: it's essentially correct as-is.
but it's not working for me
Just type in the path when you generate the key. Name it uniquely.
I'll try again
maybe dsa not rsa, also. and edit ~/.ssh/config
I don't have a ~/.ssh/config
they're good to have handy (.ssh/config file). Makes things easier when you try to login from the machine that has the ~/.config file to the one with only ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.. I meant ~/.ssh/config of course. typo.
sorry, you say that makes it easier but, how is a mystery
it allows you to skip the command line parameters and just type 'ssh myremotehostname'.
you may want to try to run this in a terminal, dpkg-log-summary
you need to make a filesystem in the partition before you can mount it. did you do that?
ubuntu version and wifi chipset please?
14.04. WNDA4100 Netgear
you might wanna search your syslog and dmesg logs to see whats happening exactly
so it's not a common problem?
didnt hear of many netgears having issues here
its a usb dongle, not a router
fully updated to 14.04.3?
yup. LTS
checked additional drivers section, if other usefull drivers showup?.  maybe check netgears website also for latest linux drivers for your dongle, or known issues/firmware
have you tried to reboot?
restricted-main?
how do i enable that?
use synaptic. system-administration->synaptic package manager
i am using synaptic, and as far as i know, restricted is already enabled
hmm
i have the xfree-fglrx. err, i have it available
add these reps [URL]
where does it hang? does it show any reactions to keypresses? have you tried to remove the "quiet" kernel option temporarily?
sudo apt-get install nvidia-current
flac -d foo.flac, make the wave then use lame to rencode as mp3
so I cant go directly from flac?
no.  you can try flac -d *.flac | lame -h -. for a full directory of flac
No need then,
it's enabled by default, no?
I believe xbindkeys
jaunty?
karmic...
er, yeah, the latest stable
yeah, running Adobe Flash 10.0 r42
would you mind telling me some of the conflicting solutions? I'm curious. I'd be happy to give you my solutions
install wine first, then just put th eCD in and it should autorun
me
uhm i have issues building the crappy driver
yea... tell me about it.  it took forever to get working
uhm okay. :D
only some of them work too.  how are you building it
i got 046d:08f6. with driver qc-usb-messenger-1.7. i got 046d:08f5 as well if that one works better. i tried with make install and the included ./quickcam.sh script.  [URL] this is the failure
use modprobe
which module?. quickcam nvm.  [11398.151142] usbcore: registered new interface driver quickcam. it does not say it registered a /dev/videoX
you need qc-usb
not qc-usb-messenger?
either should be fine.  do you have module-assistand. *assistant
yes
are you using it to compile
uhm no. should I?
uh huh.  type sudo m-a
then?
first scroll to update, and hit enter to update.  then prepare
ok, got both
then select and scroll until you find the driver and hit space to select it
ok, got it
then tab and do "ok"
binary package not found
what'd that come up after
if you get Nero for Linux, it can do it for you.
nerolinux is only for suse, debian and fedora isn't it ?
no..  works perfect for me.
I use module-assistant to do everything, then change my [URL]nf manually
probably yes
*universe
any clues?.  it's stopping me from using the upgrade tool
sry, not really.. I'm not too what the problem is..
you shouldn't need to do that
I installed something from source in /opt, should it do it on it's own?
it shouldn't need to use ldlibrary path as it will have been linked at compile time
no more getting smashed for you!
lol. I can't figure out how to get it back
When you get GPG key error : the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY FC6D7D9D009ED615. you can use the following to add the key:. sudo apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver [URL] FC6D7D9D009ED615.  ^^^
put the pc off while your not using it?
i've been doing that but then i'd have to star everything up....my browser and all the tabs, im sure you can appreciate the benefits of suspending a laptop?. so shutting is down is not an option.
ubuntu version?
14.04.3. perfectly up to date running on a dell precision m3800. thats why it's strange that it doesnt work. maybe it's because i dont have swap?
check your syslog and dmesg.  and try laptop-mode-tools
great, thanks! i was going to dig into it, but thought i'd ask here - maybe it's a frequent question. thanks for the help  +1
tail -f /var/log/syslog and go suspending might spit out some usefull things also perhaps?
. got it. cat /proc/acpi/wakeup. show you all the wakeup calls. i disabled all of them except PWRB & LID0
solved now?
i hope so, i disabled the lid too and only allowed the power button to wake the laptop. man this laptop get scary hot in my bag. im sure it wont last log if this happens to frequently
did you vacuum clean it once?
2.0.0.14+2nobinonly-0ubuntu0.7.10 ?
yes
where is this wiki?
aplay /dev/urandom should give you some noise (might be loud).  there are some switches for aplay to get info about the soundcards.. man aplay for more info
should it be all crackly???
it should just be noise.. regular "turn on the radio between stations" noise
any idea what i could do next? ;).  i have no idea how to go about this.  i'm looking at the man pages now
I'm not on friendly terms with alsa myself.. we have a small agreement.. I don't mess with it and it keeps working most of the time..=)
i was like that too, then it just stopped working. also on my windows dual boot :(
I'm sorry.. can't really help you with that.. perhaps someone else can
People in #smuxi probably do
What hardware do you have?. [URL] [URL]
I can't remember if these computers have 2GB or 3GB of ram. old windows xp computers
Are they single core?.  Or dual core?
thumb drive? usb stick?
yeah
mount /dev/sda /mnt/somewhere. mostly /dev/sda if you dont have other SCSI disks. ehm,, or sda1
I have not run into that problem. Sounds more so like a hardware issue rather than OS.
its a possiblity, just hasnt happened until recently, and I have had the same laptop since August.. Either an update or me messing with powertop. Guess I can try shutting down without powertop tweaks to confirm
What kind of laptop is it?
if i try whit user root i get filesystem read-only
john117: what are you trying to do?
are you sure its installed
I can find some entries with "find . / -name "*zlib*" but cant be sure which one is install path
aptitude install zlib1g-dev.  usually when compiling you need to install development versions of packages. the development libraries have code that the runtime libraries do not.
/boot out of space? that doesn't look like the full error. a pastebin would be good
of course
how is that supposed to work? i've tried to configure it as best i can but when i connect the the 'non internet' interface it cuts me off the internet
then set the default route to the lan with the internet
you'll need two physical devices
because of?
because thats how the cloud system works
i've had my mouse stop working when switching users
nah my mouse still works. and programs won't start but running ones work like normal
what r u doing when it stops working?
-> man interfaces
I have read it, it still isn't really clear.
-> the nic has to know what is the broadcast address
So, it's the same as my static IP?
-> nope, do you mind doing a tutorial on networking?
Not at all, have a link or something?
-> not off hand, let me google one for you
Is it even necessary?. .. to write it in I meant.
-> [URL] perhaps chapter 4
thanks. I can't just leave it empty by any chance?
-> try it, and see how it goes
I don't have a router or anything, it's just static..  what is the network in there then? :D. I only know of my IP, Gateway and DNS.. Oh, and netmask.
-> i can not explain to you all the minute details, you really have to do a network tutorial
I just meant what I should write there. :D. But yeah, I guess you're right.
-> it is easy to tell you what to put, but your are questioning why..then you must do a tutorial to get a deeper understanding
I'm sorry if I'm being ignorant. I just want my connection up and running, it's messing with me.. I'm dual-booting so it's a pain to troubleshoot.
-> explain or elaborate on your network layout.. and please use the nick prefix so your messages will not be missed
it's just a wired network, straight from my card to the wall, and I have a static IP..  I guess that's it? :)
whats behind that wall? your ISP ?
at boot you can hold shift and see the menu of what grub has detected as bootable since last update
i have the menu with multiple linux distros i can choose from. i just want to know which distros grub is the one that i see
the destro you see when grub boots as default? I don't understand that.  grub is not a destro it can boot many different destro
you can save your session
your CPU will clock up and down as needed, this saves power.  your CPU does not always run at full speed unless needed
does your HD spin quickly while using FF?
i ahve no idea.  it doesnt sound like its spinning faster than normal'
well is your computer slow when using FF?
that's different..is mounted?
yes?.  just ask your question. Someone might be able to help you out
i putty over to a lamp server w/ zenoss and suddnly the connection is lost (software reset) . after that I can't reach the box until some period of time
hmmm.....are you sure it is a SSH server issue? If you have physical access to the server, maybe you can try running tcpdump on it
man fstab
have you unmuted it in the volume control? by default it is muted.
dralid: where is that button?
by default in the upper right corner of the screen is a sound icon, right click and go to open volume control, then go to the recording section.
what command did you put there?
a command to start the net. i put in : echo "password" | sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
you should be putting it in /etc/rc.local not /etc/init.d/rc.local
Looks like a issue on their end, its not returning the SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT received string
of course. all the gui tools are merely the pretty face of the underlying CLI commands
usb does already, internal HD use fstab. if you want the either mounted specifically like a place let us know, just a vague question
No, it doesn't mount already. That is the issue
when plugged in or plugged when booted?
I guess most tiling wwindow managers don't automount, if I run nautilus, it will mount but besides that.. it won't automount booted or plugged in on any of my tested tiling window managers
Ah, must be a config somewhere.. or missing driver, never used the manger is all. can you mount from the cli
that sounds like a build file for ant. ant install or such usually. You'll need java installed
ant install is the command?
ant is like make. It follows whatever instructions are in build.xml to compile/install the program.
yeah its a java program, so do i enter ant install build.xml
usually ant install there should be a README.txt or such
netstat is the program you use
broken dns
have you read the wiki howto?
i think so
!tell  about skype
Use ndiswrapper with the xp drivers.
sudo apt-get install amarok
you can just sudo reboot. i dont know about gnome/unity.  I just use Kubuntu
depends on your needs, you can even install windows on a Virtual machine.  but if you do need to install, you'll need spare partition, if you don't have space use a live partitioning tool to make room, then install windows, then reinstall boot manager (grub)
is this just a data image  or do you plan to use it for video?
data
you can use brasero for a gui, or dd for the terminal.  which do you prefer?
terminal
dd if=/location of=[URL]o.  ^^
in hoary?
assuming the theory is correct, then you "only" need to add big amounts of ram exclusively for your file system, cool. and a ups for the comp, too. zfs is just not for the desktop, no matter what
Research! It's the only solution to ignorance. You don't need a ton of RAM. You don't need a UPS. But you seem to have an agenda, so I'll concede all your points and move on with life. :P
yeah, you don't need to have a lot of ram, you can also settle with a slow fs. for no good reason
what do you mean by permanently mount?.  you can add it to the fstab and have it mounted at a certain mountpoint if you want
yes that would be it, an article about it?
get it's uuid with blkid.  then type nano /etc/fstab and add it there. UUID=<uuid> <mountpoint> <file system type> errors=remount-ro 0 1. or use whatever options you want.  you need sudo to edit it btw
how does this look? UUID=51DDB6994E6674F0 /mnt/caddy ntfs errors=remount-ro 0 1
it's ok, give it a shot, caddy has to be created first though
wanted to ask that
so sudo mkdir /mnt/caddy
all the folks in #kubuntu are - but if you ask your next question, it might be easier to help
Do you mean reordering them at their location? ie: In your music folder?
if you're on i386, http://paste.ubuntu-[URL] is nice, libdvdcss & w32codecs are an apt-get away
you cant upgrade from 14.04 to 15.04. you need to upgrade to 14.10 before
I wipe out the old headers in synaptic without issues, except for the time I wiped out the current header, that did work out well
uname -a I guess lists the current header. so you don't delete that good one. Also the synaptics residual cofig. I can't remove those
that's a bug
Depends. Are we talking just in gnome-terminal (the terminal app), or in TTYs as well?.  If the former, it's under edit->profile preferences.
wait....
whats up
yer ok cuz pidgin is an ubuntu package...
well I posted in #pidgin as well hehe
have that person im u, and with the im open, right click their name in the upper left, and choose unblock
I cant get it booted, and I dont know what drive is my boot drive...
your software defenitely does not run with the new version?
no
you could file a regression bug
I'm interested in how to build .deb from a different version of linux. or rather distro
apt-get source and dpkg-buildpackages -us -uc afterwards.  but, if there are lib dependencies, which cannot be installed.  cause new ubuntu needs the newer libs, there will be a big problem
Won't apt-get source just pull the code from 10?
how many packages do you need?.  if you do it on 8.0.4 you geth them.  for 10 you are right of course
Fritsch: How would I do it from a 10 machine?
you could add src sources for the old version.  and fetch apt-get source with this special version.  apt-get source erlangPackage=1.0.x.y.  what erlang packages do you have installed?
Okay, I guess if I setup the pinnings correctly then I will not end up with more packages from 8 on 10 than I need
i hope so
is there a way to do it without messing around with apt and the sources file?
before rebuilding, you could also add the lucid binary sources.  and install the mdirectly.  meaning add: deb [URL] lucid main restricted universe multiverse
I believe I need, erlang-base, erlang-dev and erlang-nox
apt-get update && apt-get install erlang-base=1.0.x.y.  replacing 1.0.x.y with the version you need
ideally I want to rebuild it on 10 so it is native for 10, then use the PPA to setup future servers
okay, so just get the 8.04 sources, buildpackages, bump your version number, that it is bigger than the 10 version.  i would rather fix the current erlang version.  do you have an error mesage, what happens, if you run your software on the 10 version?
Sadly it isn't that simple
erlang is rather old, so if 10 version is not working anymore, this is a big problem
The code does not compile with a newer version of Erlang, and while updates exist for to correct this. These updates break other things
so the ubuntu erlang version is broken?
Not at all, we are forced to run an old version of ejabberd, and an old version of ejabberd is not compatible with Erlang R13
http://www.erlang-[URL] <- did you have a look here.  oha, okay.  no chance of porting?
No
okay, than there is no other solution, just messing up :-).  let me have a look of the build depends
x86 and i386 are 32bit. x86_64 and amd64 are 64bit
is there a reason you know of why someone woud publish with a specific name like amd64, if it worked on any 64 bit OS?
It's just tradition to call the 64bit amd64, because AMD was the one who invented the 64 bit extensions
: how about the 386 name, doesn't it also work for 586 and 686?
But it doesn't actually matter if the CPU is AMD or Intel.  Yep.
what does it do...
Try to reinstall Kubuntu as mode 'expert' when you boot.
Was anything written to the MBR? Since GRUB isn't working?
If you run the installation CD with 'expert'mode
if you're a new user i would just choose '/'
rehan: cool that's what i figured thanks
no prob, i'm new to ubuntu too, just started :P
<unconvertable>  can you log into ubuntu?
yes. Yes .. I am currently in ubuntu
<unconvertable>  ok on desktop upper left side in text go to /system/prefs'/keyboard leftclick it. <unconvertable>  then go to tab "Layouts"
@  done.... done @
<unconvertable>  under "keyboard model search for your keyboard
what wireless card do you have?
It isnt a wireless card. Its a usb adapter to wifi. Netgear WNDA3100 V2
long story short, if you don't have a CAT5 internet connection you're gonna have to download the .tar.gz and build it from the makefile
A what?
the cable that plugs the internet into your computer directly from the router
for some devices like my bluetooth speakers I've had to push the reset botton to get them released from the last device they were bond to
so, clearing the memory so to speak...
it clear the bind it had with my android phone so my computer could use it
on your computer, or the one you're ssh'ing to?
Sadly, this is a known bug in Pulseaudio. Our best suggestion is switching all the audio preferences and gstreamer-properties over to ALSA.
dpkg -i <file>
different encoding? utf8 is used in ubuntu maybe the db is another one
I also use utf as the encoding for the database.  I also use utf8 as the encoding for the database
then i dunno. something mangles it along the way ?
sounds like a power issue
but I never had it before..
can you do me a favour, do you have a live cd on you by chance?
facepalm.  VARIABLE=value.  env
i do stuff like hdparm -d1 -m16 -A1 -a320 -u1 -X mdma2 -c3 /dev/hdc
opinions here are opinions nothing else, and we don't do that.
what does came up black mean??
i can log in to the machine .. but i have a cursor but no desktop ... i did have a desktop come up once .. but the colors were way skewed
you mean you can log in but then a black screen appears..??
i can log in .. and that is whte ... but then the screen turns black and there is no desktop ... but i have a mouse cursor.  i think its a nvidia issue .. but i forgot how to fix it
have you tried to move to text mode use alt-ctrl-f1.  well had this happened with you earlier.
i am there no.  now.  this started when i upgraded
ya upgrade it screwed my system too..i was also having some nvidia issues when i had to format and reinstall hardy
ok, is there maybe a way to get the video to work ?
may be you should try posting it on some forums..they could help you in a better way...
havent found much ... i know i fixed this once here
you can't even login why do you want to run a video..
i can login ... i am at a desktop ... but its blank
well i think you should try to go to text mode and try restarting gdb
whats the command for it
shadowsulf: sudo /etc/init.d/gdb restart. shadowsulf: then switch back to graphical mode by pressing alt-ctrl-f5 or f7 try both of them i m not sure..
ok, whats the command line to restart gdb
sudo /etc/init.d/gdb restart.  doesn't it work??
checking now
oh i m sorry its "gdm" and not "gdb".  graphical desktop manager (gdm)
I think for a quesiton like that , you might want to so a search in the forum [URL].  sounds to me like the "mouse" part of the monitor is not oriented properly
should be able to
try sudo rm -Rf /var/lib/apt/lists/partial/*.  then sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock.  then sudo apt-get -f update.  see http://ubuntu-[URL]
Ultras: no
as yo see, it searches for other dirs/files in $PWD which don't exist in bin/
so it's a program problem, not linking it?
it works, if you call "/opt/openoffice4/program/soffice" directly?
yes, . I just made aooffice to be a script, that does 'cd /opt/openoffice4/program/ ' and then './soffice' . And it works. Even /usr/bin/soffice (that comes from LibreOffice is actually a script. Only thing that wasn't done was installing AOO menu icons, because .deb provided by Apache does not work on Ubuntu. Must report that to them to fix that
yes, because those change $PWD into the /opt/openoffice.... where other needed files are found. your simple symlink doesn't, so it fails
well yes sort of
how are you installing?
CD..
what version?
11.04
32 or 64 bit?
32
how far into the install did you get?
has it worked prior?
Yeah, always.
and if you log out and back into GNOME?
what graphics card are you using?
nVidia Corporation NV11 [GeForce2 MX/MX 400]
are you using the nvidia binary drivers?
I'm not sure. How do I check?
are you on using feisty?
yes.
System -> Admin -> Restricted Driver manager
yes, I see it in the window and it's in use.
well you can use AIGLX. To turn compiz on just go into System->Preferences->Desktop effects
I cannot use desktop effects since the title bars of windows will disappear.
you tried?
I tried enabling desktop effects, but the title bars dissapeared, so I could not move the windows around. Other than that, it worked.
oh well ask in #ubuntu-effects for help witht that
A user needing sudo?
why are you needing to do this?
sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
.docm???
works now?
yes
same thing happened here. I made a wiki page for it.
netgear wg511 v2
broadcom here
?
yes
Okay. I am having some problems. After following this guide [URL] it still doesn't work. I cannot ping the host on the client side and vice versa after connecting
I just followed that guide yesterday for two machines in virtualbox.. it worked for me.. I still have to enable ip_forwarding manuall after I reboot... but apart from that it should work
Maybe I haven't enabled ip_forwarding? How do I do that?
sudo -i then echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward then exit no reboot needed.. it should start working right away
Nope, still cannot ping. Maybe there is some problem with the eth1 device? Can I check that it is working correctly somehow?
ehm.. I'm not really sure.. network cards usually work if they are detected by lspci and such.. I don't really know how to "test" any other way
"sudo chmod 755 /home/desktop/folder" ??
Makefile not [URL]. This channel is too fast for me
I'm a long time Debian user - and I keep an extra Debian nearby at all times....
sudo apt-get install keychain; man keychain
It's a command like program to install/uninstall programs. Using the Synaptic frontend is usually recommended.. *line
:S  after reading a forum........i found that best way to fix my problem is threw apt-get. as the other guy with the exact same problem that was the only way he won ;)
Well, to use it, start a terminal and use 'sudo apt-get [install/remove/whatever] [package name] .'
is it cd or dvd?
dpkg -l |grep fglrx
yeah, it didn't list anything
then I don't think you have any drivers for radeons from amd installed at all
i've made sure fglrx is installed. modprobe -l even shows it loaded. or is flgrx just a generic driver? if so, not to bug, but do you know how to get ahold of ati drivers from cli?
if there is no package at all installed which has "fglrx" as part of the name then the drivers are not installed. and you said there'd be none
get another wireless card
I have a dv6000, got it working using ndiswrapper and the windows driver
could write a script, grep the output, and loop if failed.
i would think wget would just have an option for it though
doubt it.. OK .. a simple manpage lookup. -t, --tries=NUMBER set number of retries to NUMBER (0 unlimits).
what resolution does your monitor support and what do you have it set at?
what are you using?
xchat irc
sorry, I thought you said you were "not" using xchat :)
the packages are broken, check if there is a bug logged, if not log one
vanilla [URL]st.  no buglogged..
then I suggest you log one
o man.... running a production machine here. need to go live today
so ?.  then you should do proper planning
yeah .. i know ' no guarantees'
no, just proper planning and testing
been testing and planning for 3 months
then how do you not know the package is broken ?
it worked fine 3 weeks ago
so you're deploying a machine on the day it's supposed to go live, that doesn't seem like a good plan.  also as you know ubuntu is updated on a regular basis, have you kept up with the package status for your deployment ?
that is where it went wrong, i have not been at the machine for some weeks
ok, so that's not planning
i know, i scored below average on my ITIL test
log a bug for it
will do
consider using LTS releases 10.04 for example for production use
Make a backup, remove the file, if it fixes the problem then good to go. If not, replace with backup.
System -> Preferences -> Appearance
what if I can't access X?
Can you get to the GDM login screen?
Well for now my system works completely.  but I am certain once I update my compiz packages, I will be able to get to GDM but not to gnome.  I've had this behaviour twice before and had to reinstall
Certainly no need to reinstall because of that, you can start a failsafe gnome session from the GDM login screen, or disable compiz from the terminal
I checked appearance, it seems to be turned off tho. So I don't get it.
So what exactly is the problem? You have compiz installed but not enabled and when you update it it tries to start but fails even though it shouldn't have tried to start in the first place?
Yes.  it's the only packages that aren't updated.  when I update, gnome freezes on login.  it flashes the bars a few times and then freezes and my Hd goes way up.  it must be compiz, it's the only packages left I haven't updated
What happens when you login in a failsafe-gnome session?
I shall install them now. wish me luck
If you don't have another computer get irssi so you can get help without X
compiz, compiz-core, compiz-fusion-plugins-extra, compiz-gnome, compiz-plugins, libdecoration0. those are the ones I'm updating to 1:0.6.2.  ok, should I do a full reboot or just ctrl+backspace?
just ctrl+alt+bckspace
im not sure but i think ssh can do it via mocp. yeah doc
What a pretty you trying to do? Wubi?
sure, have multiple partitions on it
<unconvertable>  i have it, and use it once in a while, what seems to be the issue ?
You mean in nautilus? menu > Edit > Backgroung & ...
might want to try #ubuntu-offtopic or another channel, as that is not really directly ubuntu stuff
That very stupid of them.
why do you say that?
debian has been stable for _years_..  Last i checked servers needed stability.
you replaced the ? right?
: yes
and what did you do before that?
: I just followed the instructions on how to change the resolutions
what did you do exactly?
: I was able to restart X because I remembered the command used, and it seemed to work after that, it just didn't auto-restart like I expected
that command works here
ok i got file sharing working, it wont be long now. yay gigabit :D
woot!
ok this is gonna sound dumb, how do i start wine? :P
umm you can configure it gavein but as far as runing it jut run the ap just like its in windows
ok,cool.  lol would help if i had wine installed... sigh
lol
ok installing rct3 now. you were able to install it right?
yes gavin. instled fine'
k
shouldn't need to
darn cause I can't get the no password option to work.
pastebin your /etc/sudoers. How are you executing the command?
techno ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL.  techno would be my user name..  I also did: root ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
pastebin your /etc/sudoers. How are you executing the command?
[URL]
and my question?
psycoewok, cus its picky
ready ? i asume they tested the model and find no problem installing Ubuntu..  try it yourself with live-cd
they won't be on your system by default
What is the package name? lib6c ?. -dev
no.  what needs them ?
I sent you a PM
i receive no pm
umm
maybe you're not registered
then maybe I don't know how to send one. I'm not registered I don't think, I've never used ICQ before
this is not ICQ!!! this is Irc!!!!
yea I know. err...I mistyped. lol
look in the syslog
by spash image you mean the nice "ubuntu" splash that pops up while the computer is booting?
yes.  so, any ideas?
yeah I think i might have a link for you one sec, gotta dig it up
sure
having trouble finding this link sorry, my bookmarks all seem to have vanished...
is it unmounted?
yes.  ^
barretg: what options did you use on fsck?
you need to find the corect file, it is mentionned in this guide somewhere youcan make a small edit to it , [URL]
with iwconfig
it means one of 2 things: a) pulseaudio isn't setup right, or b) you have a half-duplex soundcard.
on a laptop?
service command.  service --status-all list all services.  service ssh status show the status info of ssh
See "man [URL]nf"
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be seeing. The MAILADDR line seems to be what I'm looking for, but that doesn't answer my question of whether or not it's sufficient to put my user name
information on MAILADDR and an example.  The example shows user@domain.tld
command line or whith some filemenager?
you can do 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc' and tell it to install to the other hd. is one way. theres a dozen ways to get grub to install to the other hd.
lower the screen res
did you order one of the packages of cds? or did you make a custom order?
Working with my 9700 Pro.
did u follow a particular guide?
No. It's an R300, it's supposed by the open source drivers..  The 9800, I suspect, probably isn't an R300?
how can i find out?
Google.. Unless you boot of the windows installer CD.. That does. :). Such as?. Windows can't read Linux partitions, so other than the MBR, there isn't anyhting for it.. It does not do that.
[URL]ng has it as a R350 NH
Then it's not supported.
i do have drivers installed. fglrx
Those do not support AIGLX.. And likely never will.. Heh.
=(
You can use xgl though.. Which is different from AIGLX.
the xorg-driver-fglrx is not open source??
No. It's ATI's propriatary drive.
ic
The "radeon" driver is open source, and has recent support for full acceleration on R300 and below.. But not yet above.. So, with an R300, it "Just Works"

Obviously guys are working hard to make it work with yoru card, but ya know, it's closed stuff. It's very hard. ;)
you want it on a tmpfs?
ioria: yes. ioria: the os already exist it's not a new installation
there should be a systemd mount unit you can enable
I'm a bit lazy hit me with the commands
copy /usr/share/systemd/tmp.mount to /etc/systemd and enable it.  /etc/systemd/system, sorry
thanks.  cp: cannot stat /usr/share/systemd/tmp.mount: No such file or directory.  or I'm doing something wrong
which ubuntu is this?
Trusty
sorry then, that hasn't got systemd :) hang on, i've got a line somewhere you can put in fstab. give me a minute.
okay, thanks
'tmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,noatime,nosuid,nodev,noexec,mode=1777,size=512M 0 0'.  just adjust size= to whatever you want
son of .... thats should works thanks - I mean it looks good..  you think 512 is enough?
how much ram has your machine got?
12 GB
the way it works is that it allocates what it needs dynamically up to that limit, see what /tmp uses on your system now under normal use
I know I don't need it , based on my ram. ok. tham. thanks
/tmp here uses under a megabyte, but it depends on the software you run.
sudo mount -a outputs: [mntent]: line 15 in /etc/fstab is bad.  take a look at my fstab [URL]
look at the end of the line.  you included a '
do you have a really good reason to be using telnet? the 80's called and want its telnet server back :)
im using telnet to test access to my Kannel bearerbox port
checked if a firewall is blocking it?
im using ufw and i have opened this port to whole word.  telnet ip port works from same server, telnet ip port dosnt work from another server
telnet daemon conf ? it is binding to LAN ip ?
What are you doing with usermod? Adding someone to groups? Changing their default group?
what's the problem?
applications restricted by law
yep, some countries (the US included) restrict some apps by law, mostly some patented aurio/video codecs. The users should be aware of that, don't you think?
subscribe and edit it yourself....  help the community growing up
it depends of your video card
Nvidia GTX 360M.  I already have proprietary drive,. but splash and terminals are at very lower resolution. and I can't set wide resolution
it is normal, the propietary drivers have this problem with plymouth.  but yu can fix it
it's a matter of personal taste
well what are some easily seen differences
the interface.  you can see the differences between them on their respective sites
clarify 'changing the sound' You mean changing the volume?
no, i would say that was somthing being broken.. my pos old ocmputer boots in about 19 seconds
whats the date on that source package?
i dont know
did you install madwifi from source?
You still there?
update-manager
are you sure you forwarded to the correct internal LAN IP?
yeah it's for breezy, fix it
sure
do you have smooth transitions between tracks?
define smooth :). like cross fading?
yeah well not necessarily smooth as in faded, but do you get this "silent -> 0.5s bit of strange noise -> new track starts" sort of thingie? :P
I have no strange noise. just track end -> silence switching to new song -> new song
it goes to silent first, and then it plays just a bit from the end of last track, as it would flush buffer or something. could be my ancient cpu tho :P
which rhythmbox do y ou use... the standard one?. rhythmbox-gstreamer. ?
doesn't the restrictedformats give you the codecs for AAC [URL]
sacarlon, does it give me the encoder?. I have a 1.2gb video and want to knock it down for youtube.
you have the encoder you just need the codec.  mplayer also has an encoder
It does? all this time I was using VLC >.<. Of course it does. memcoder -.-.  Where is the 'encoder' options? I'm assuming I can't do it through a UI?
I don't know I haven't played with that in 3 years
where (hardware wise) do you suppose the bottleneck is? RAM/SWAP? CPU? HDD?
I have 2GB of ram... maybe hard drive. I just replaced my hard drive
run 'top' in a terminal
but it was working better than this after I replaced it. this was rather sudden.  okay, I'm running top
what's your system load average? are there processes at the top, eating up all your resources?
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 stop
I still see the default page at localhost
ps aux | grep apache.  kill the PID of the apache proccesses
it worked this time. Can you tell me which directory it reads files from?
the default configdir is: /etc/apache2
I put a html file in /usr/share/apache2/default-site/ but I get a 404 error
each vhost file will define the it's own rootdir for serving files.  by default, its always somewhere in /var/www
the button on the keyboard?
check your router
proper forwarding has been done
what error when trying from WAN?
The connection has timed out.  The connection has timed out
any blocking iptables-rules on the machine?
you simply need 3D accelerated display and unity will run.
right, because your OS disk does not have a boot sector on it (grub). or valid boot loader I should say. normally because the graphics drivers are shut down. it can't remember the location
huh. I am at the step with the partition menu and it says: ubi-partman failed with exit code 141. further information can be found in /var/log/syslog.. y that my install might fail
repeat the process I told you earlier. that worked last time
I'm restarting the install. the partitions should be gone
why don't you just explain the issue, so that people know if they can help
I got the same message. its perplexing. reboot and select proper boot device
same thing - it's not installing grub to the device you are booting from
can I install grub another way?
the installer is fine, just during the install make sure you select the correct device
it's the whole harddrive
yes, but there are 2 disks in your system, the hard disk and the usb disk
some_person: try vlc, also called videolan, it can stream nearly anything
What do you meant by "pre-install"?
I have made a dedicated partition on my external drive for GRUB. I'm in Ubuntu Studio 13.10. I have a 3 TB external drive
I assume you're doing this because you plan to have multiple GNU/Linux distros installed and want grub to be in a separate partition so that any of them can be deleted without breaking grub. If that's not your end goal, please state your end goal.
installing from a tar.gz can be a bit complicated.  usually these packages are the pure source code. where did you get the package?
system -> administration -> shared folders ?
do you have a support question?
do you have a clean install CD?
you are connected to freenode now, so it has not gone down
functionality in what sense
simple menus, easy to change themes, gnome-panel
install gnome-panel and use that.  or use Xubuntu 12.04
you can "fix" that by removing the CD from your apt sources
did postfix run fine before ?
no I really couldn't get it working :S .. have managed to set it up before 1-2 times but I thought that because I only need a relay-smtp I could use some easier solution
do you have a firewall running ?
you mean a firewall as an router where I can open ports etc?..when I think of firewall I always think of something like windows firewall which I can stop but I haven't seen anything like that on ubuntu :O
well I mean both actually. there are also firewalls on ubuntu, could you check the output of 'service ufw status'
ufw start/running
ok so you do have a firewall running
oh hehe :O so I should stop ufw?
either you stop it, or you allow connection on port 25, via "sudo ufw allow 25"
ah yeah thats better ..but do I really need a connection on port 25 on my machine if I only want to use relay-smtp?. @  *
yes your machine will still be seen as a mail server from any client connecting to it, and you will need to allow smtp connections to it
aha oki then I get it  but still after allowing port 25 and trying to telnet localhost 25 I get the same error message while running nullmailer
is the nullmailer service running ?
yeah I guess :P
to be sure, "service nullmailer status"
didn't work they want me to use /etc/init.d/nullmailer instead of service and then there's no status attribute :O
then try "sudo /etc/init.d/nullmailer restart" and then try to connect via telnet again
still same error :P
ok, then back to the firewall... could you pastebin the output of "sudo ufw status" ?
[URL]  don't you mean "sudo service ufw status" ? .. sudo ufw status returns Status:inactive but sudo service ufw status returns ufw start/running
no I meant "sudo ufw status", but then it means that the firewall isn't enabled... so the problem does not come from there unless you have some other firewall running
I have a new installation of ubuntu and haven't installed some other firewall :).  while I was running postfix before I managed to telnet just fine but then the authentication failed :S.  so I guess it's not the firewall
after looking at the documentation, it appears I didn't understand what nullmailer was....  it only handles outgoing messages, so you won't be able to connect to it via smtp.  have a look at the manpages for nullmailer, nullmailer-inject, nullmailer-queue and nullmailer-send
how do you mean only outgoing ? should I still be able to send a message using another SMTP with nullmailer?
yes, but it won't allow you to connect to your machine remotely to do it.  nullmailer is only a set of tools used to send mail from your machine using a remote smtp sever. *server*
clean install 14.04.2
<> sorry I don't have ubuntu cd for the time being I have only internet accsess
time to get one. I always keep my ubuntu USB around my neck ... just i case.
only takes a few hundred MB of transfer iirc.  so maybe a few days on a lightly used network, vs a few min on a heavily used one
exactly
so wep is still useless
<unconvertable>  cd to directory then chown -R useryouwant:useryouwant *
Try `netstat -lntp` and `netstat -lnup`
try check the disk
any particular check tool you have in mind?
chkdsk
i have done that. it tests ok, smart reports ok.
on all 4 partitions?
yep, the drive is fine. should i be mounting just the one partition? this is a system that doesn't have the raid setup...
what do you get when you try to mount the first partition
/dev/sdb1 has no superblock
have you any sensitive data on your drive?
.9tb of them
do you know which filesystem is used?
not the same youre right
you went and put the /home on there didn't you :(
nope. I havent touched that yet. still installing just to SSD as per normal. but it sense the raid. Once I get installed to SSD with RAID detecting then I will ask for next steps :). I just wanna move my home and cache to the RAID. then set the SSD to read only. That should prolong the SSD life exponentially correct?
still 100% disagree with your plan
Almost indefinnitely
no, your idea is silly. you need to do OS updates regularly, you can't set it read only
Touche...
plus you have a samsung 840, that puppy is good for 10+ years. *minimum*
which firefox version?
yes. 0. ff - 1.0.2
hmm
sudo update-rc.d -f servicename remove
which?
check the forums. and what various linux-laptop-computer web sites sell
you mean to make it faster?
yes it fluctuates
lynx [URL] is imo the only command to make it faster.  with other words, you cant make your card faster then it is
from 54 to 300. no the speed changes
ah you mean to use wifi in n-mode
bad memory on the vid card can cause artifacts.
'uname -r' in console
remove the 'splash'
okay... looking...  this line? "# defoptions=quiet splash"
yes, and also on in the 'do not change this bit' bit. you change it on that line for the next update, the others so it takes effet now
v1.3?!? can't be .. it should be like this --> X Window System Version x.x.x
#gcc probably can
no. use the existing one..  and its better not to..  why do you want to use the super user account from ubuntu?
add chown mpd:mpd /var/run/mpd to /etc/rc.local.  but rather file a bug
but do you know what's resetting the permissions each boot?
nope.  this is what i would looking for first.  how do you hange the permissions after you booted?
what?
if you boot and see the right wrong - what are you doing then?
if the see the... right wrong?
you issue chown -R mpd:mpd /var/run/mpd?.  sorry for my bad english: the rights of the folder
pxe ?
yes
ok thought so.
no sorry i read wrong, 64 bit can be faster though
Will it show up if you do places -> connec to server?
does the driver get loaded?.  as in, the first boot?
i believe so. I have specified it in interfaces file, and kwifimanager as well. i have entered the WEP key as well
try this: sudo iwconfig wlan0 essid "NetworkNameHere"
i did that. followed by iwconfig wlan0 commit as well
you mean a web browsable repository? or more of the version control aspect?
i need a version of a package more recent than dapper, but older than currently in edgy
nope, you'll need to build your own
right. so where do i find older source packages?
older source packages? From the project.  depending on the package, you could get the source to build it from debian
iwconfig
.......I only see the current 2.47 freq....not the 5 ghz network
And you have dual band WiFi NIC?
what drivers? Is something not working?
need driver for display, wireless
warfaren, why? What is the problem?.  does it not work after install?
why would you use lilo?
because grub messed arround slakware. i try before. so i want to try with lilo. yesterday i have the login screen on it but no keyboard or mouse. any ideas. what will be best
tried simply installing lilo?
i try already. no keyboard no mouse. just installing wirth lilo
that is not a grub problem
ofcourse i think the problem is that i dont really know how to. but im pretty sure is posible. can u show me please
of course it is. but you probably have to do everything manually.
think about it for a minute, whats the ip address of your host and your guest os?
- host is 192.168.0.7, guest is 192.168.0.9
and the vmware has what? NAT? bridged? host only?
you probably have to configure conky's conkyrc file.  have you taken a look at the conkyrc file to see what it is?
you shouldn't run it as root. you should run it as your normal user
but if I run as user I can't access windows disk. there saved pasword database
you can mount the windows disk as the user you are running as, and you can access it
do you mean have windows control you ubuntu system, or the other way around?
what version of Ubuntu are you using?
no
have you looked at help pages along these lines: [URL]
yes i have a no luck
you have followed all those possible steps?
many times before and also reinstall ubuntu on this computer to start fresh
if you have openfire working via the web, it's not an OS problem; it's likely a database problem
ok thats what i thought but i can never seam to get it to worjk
when you go into mysql, you see the database you have created?
i use the internal database that comes with it
ok. so when you reinstall openfire everytime, are you given the opportunity to set an admin password at all?
its prob the firewall on the Winblows 7 pc blocking it
nah, i can connect from other windows machines
what version OS you running (linux)
10.10
are you trying to connect via IP or DNS?
with compiz or not
happens with compiz turned on or off. currently its off, but it is installed on box
what video card, which driver and how installed
is it an internal or external drive
you are running a system check ?
yea i put sudo fsck in to the terminal
why not just set a command to run system check for next boot
you can use net send
lock down the mail relay, lock down the user accounts, lock down the web interface.  there is no guide
just ask thew question you want to ask, please.
the question is about driver installation and why my wireless device is showing up but not broadcasting
what device? how is it attached? what chipset? what device drivers are you using, and from where? how did you install them? can you see SSIDs? etc etc etc.
Belkin f9l1101v1, broadcom, windows drivers via ndiswrapper, Not broadcasting so No ssid
Broadcom what? they make a lot of chipsets.
dunno what broadcom chipset lemme check
BCM4323.  that does not require ndiswrapper.
I beg to differ
BCM43xx drivers for Linux will work with that.
the free drivers don't work
have you booted the machine with the dongle attached so that the kernel knows the device is there when it's choosing what modules to load?
On several occasions
and what does "lsmod | grep bcm" say when you do?
On full hardware boot, virtual machine boot,. prob nothing as i've blacklisted the included drivers. nada
grep b43
Why would you need to revert that?
i need to run truecrypt
And it requires and older version of glibc?
i hav installed it from apt-get, it installed f9 , now when i run it it gives me error
np
truecrypt: /lib/tls/i686/cmov/[URL].6: version `GLIBC_2.4' not found (required by truecrypt)
that is a dangerous lib to change, i dont reccomend it. Have you looked into luks?
okaym i dunno about luks
I'm using it on my whole drive, and it will be sufficient security for what you need, check out using that instead.. !luks |
Is there a message that comes up, ?
yes. when i go to some sites it says
Okay, Firefox right?
try to disable the floppy disk in bios
are they sata?
...
I have copied the file to webserver location, how can i access now. e.g.: i am trying ftp://localhost/foldername/filename
ah.  you would actually need the server connected to a domain or public IP.  better go back to scp
you're using Gnome?
did you run w/ sudo ?
what package manager were you using?
I was using sudo apt-get on Kubuntu. (I'd try their irc, but hardly anyone is around. )
pgrep -l apt-get
Rylu: 3848 apt-get
do you still have that open somewhere, by any chance?
Raylu, How? I've restarted my computer twice since then.
then apt-get wouldn't be running.  or, at least, the apt-get that you ran two restarts ago wouldn't
boot the liveCD and create a new one. install grub to it..  [URL] will help
how to fix deleted boot partition?
are you ignoring my suggestions?
gnome-[URL] has a lot of stuff, dunno if they have what you're after.
yeah, just browsing - they are the best and the only ones?
best, no clue, i'm not a desktop guy. only one, far from it.
how do I restart unity session to see all color changes applied?
relogin?
any other method? I have to kill all windows to do that
not a unity user, sorry. are you talking about titlebar colors etc?
give more details
open your case and look
you mean PCE-AC68, right? which ubuntu version are you running?
what client do you use?
common test.. try making a new user, see if they work. also clarify to the channel your version of ubuntu and what you installed exactly.
dr_willis thanks, but i just needed to turn something on in gnome-tweak
why do you need a /boot/ parttion?.  cant say i really have needed to use that tool in ages.
dr_willis :P. my more important problem is that after installing GNOME, when i switch back to unity, the close button is on the right
thats a theme setting for the most part these days. (its tweakable by various tools). the themes just have a script i recall that sets it to the other side,. if you want it moved.. move it back. ;). !controls
one option I might suggest is xdcmp, unless you have a need to control the display
I thought VNC was supposed to let me control this computer (all my windows and apps) from another computer..
it is, but it works by letting you control the same screen as your other computer is using
unrar
so just apt-get install unrar?
yes
freezes so you can't switch vt's, even?
yes, keyboard works, but linux doesn't act to nothing. i can turn on/off num lock and all those lights :)
can you type CTRL+ALT+F1 to get a login prompt? If you ping the box from somewhere else (if that's a possibility) does it respond?
i cant. ctrl alt f1 or f2 or anything else won't work, also ctrl + c and all those..
hmm. the first thing I would do is boot from the Ubuntu Live disc and take gdm out of the default startup level. then you can boot the system and troubleshoot from the command prompt - if you want to do that.
i don't have the liveCD. so i need to download it
yeah. :(
you need to use sudo. also, you might consider, if you're installing manually, instead putting them in /usr/local/sbin so they don't get confused with apt-installed packages. also, this is linux--our slashes go forward
lol sorry  :D. and thanks
np! i hope it helps
the same way you mounted it before. with mdadm
well the last time i did it, i edited the mdraid file, but that's not there anymore
try /etc/mdadm/[URL]nf iirc
can you give me an example
the linux kernel will manage your ram to give you the best performance
right now is only using 11% of it. Can't i do anything to use more of it, and make it efficient ?
why do you think it's only using %11 ?
Ikonia: because that's what conky, and system monitor is telling me,
that means it only needs %11 as "active" at thie moment, you'll find more will be use for things such as disk cache, and when it needs it will swap it to active
yes, when released you will get the final
you can only upgrade with a CD if it is the alternate CD. !upgrade >  (see the private message from ubotu)
There aren't tools to easily do that in-place
presumably it's relatively trivial if you can backup everything outside the [already-encrypted] home partition. aye. truecrypt had some magic for it on windows istr, but god knows. and seems potentially fragile. i'll probably just backup my data and do a reinstall
if the system is using LVM and has reserved some free extents, it should be possible to recreate
what are the important things to save other than homedir, dotfiles and configs from /etc for configured packages. in fact, is it possible to use apt-* to list all configuration files associated with installed non-default packages?. that seems doable and might allow for a relatively interaction-free reconfigure of a fresh install
there'll be configs under /var/lib for some packages too
aye, but apt keeps track of what's config. at least, there's remove/purge so it is savvy to the difference between functionality files and config files
it depends what kind of partitioning the system is currently using, and how its split up. It's sometimes possible to find free space to bootstrap a post-install encryption
if tmux works similar to screen in this respect, you can set the terminal type in its configuration file
I have, why?
I'm just trying to work out why 'cos wicd loses the connection but doesn't notice, which nm never seemed to do, so I'd rather use nm
I thought you said wicd works, and nm doesnt?
yeah, on this particular hardware, which is the problem
or more to the point, are you running intrepid, with an atheros wifi card?
no.
automatix tends to break things
i see
you're better of starting from scratch than trying to repair what automatix broke
sudo apt-get install python-mode didn't do it for you?
- OpenSSH?
just files, or directories too?
Alt + f2 > "pkill firefox" (without the quotes), then try it :)
might want to try using the boot option "nomodeset".  Start a reboot and hold down the Shift key. Press the e key on getting the GRUB bootloader. Using arrow keys navigate to and delete quiet and splash and type the word nomodeset in their place. Press Ctrl and X at the same time to continue booting.  see if that gets you into your desktop
THX  - i will try it now
you can also access "recovery" while in the grub boot menu too.
chroot and reinstall grub?
other than google (or maybe even the ubuntu forums) no. I think the only difference would be that the data cable has more copper connections than the charging one, so I would assume you just add a few. But then Im sucking my thumb.
Get an answer yet? [URL] might help
no i haven't, thanks i will check that out
: Did you want to resize the Windows part or expand the Linux part?
my problem is that my linux partion is just big enough for the system files and i have to room to download updates and etc. Is there anyway to just tell ubuntu where to download to instead?
Ubuntu will download to or in Ubuntu, I guess you can save the downloads on a Flash,CD-R or whatever, I am also pretty certain that you can expand the install, but let me look for that.
ok thanks
You can expand the volume, ext2/ext3 can be expanded with Gparted or some like utility, I find it easier to back up data , do a fresh install with parameters set as you prefer.
i was thinking about that, i just installed Ubuntu a day or two ago so i have no data to loose. If i just start the install process again with the CD will it delete my current install or will i end up with 2 instances of Ubuntu on my system?
It will write over or delete the current install and settings
Have you tried doing: sudo apt-get -f install && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade ==> to see if the "-f" will FIX the "installation" along with doing the necessary update/upgrade...which sometimes will resolve the "config" issues?
yes with no sucess
And is it safe to assume that you've gone through the process of doing "sudo dpkg-reconfigure" for PHP...?
no..let me try it.  i get "php7.0 is broken or not fully installed"
You can use the "sudo apt-get reinstall php7.0" -> see what does produces...
"Internal Error, No file name for php7.0:amd64" :S
"sudo apt-get -f reinstall php7.0" (or whatever the package name is)
Is it enabled in your Vbox settings?
it's a strange problem, but anyway.  sudo nano /etc/X11/[URL]nf
booting from usb ?
is ubuntu on hda3 or hda4?
hda3
then grub should say (hd0,2) and that's what you had
hda4 is the Swap, if I remember correctly...
can you mount the partition from a live cd even?
haven't try to mount from the Live cd.
try it. see if you get an error and if you do post it
then do this: chmod 755 GERally, and then ./GERally
Did you install wpasupplicant?
ah no. yes sorry. it is there
Hrm, not sure then...can you connect to open wireless points?
hrmm. no I can't
I had wireless issues (broadcom chipset sucks) and had to go through hoops to get it to work
ask
i want to set up my webcam.  its quickcam logitech
what's the problem?
how do i do it??
plug it in for a start
its already plugged in
so what are you trying to do with it?
depends what you want it to do.  i have had hosting on both
a webpage or two.. plus some java
in that case it wouldnt matter. i'd go with the Debian server myself (because i understand it better)
thats why I initially went with debian.. but someone else suggested freebsd.. And I'm wondering how I should weigh the two
if you want your rfcs implemented before the ink is dry use freebsd. if you want 10 year release cyle use Debian, but this is -offtopic
if untarring it produes the source then yes you need to compile it
only thing that comes out is docs, utserver, and webgui.zip
wait i'm downloading now, i'll get a definite soon
thanks.  it almost seems like to be it isn't for desktop users but for webservers only
tried it now, yeah its run as a daemon/service and its all configured via a html page, not practical for a desktop user i suppose :(.  not like a daemon/service more like a background application
you have it set to lts only
more like a classpath issue
do you know how to go about fixing it?
is this started by a script ?
only by typing 'frostwire' into a terminal
the app is not able to find the jars needed to run - you could see if frostwire is a script - if so, take a look at it and see if it defines the location for the jars
rsync
what happens when you try playing media?
i get a cant open media for writing error
which app are you using?
then you should host it properly.  rather than on a home connetion with dynamic dns
did you write down the loooong password that ubuntu gave you after you first set up your encrypted homedir?
yeah
eh, k, I didn't expect that. let me check.
I tried following some instructions to remount it elsewhere, but the mount came up empty
did you try the instructions on [URL] Your Data Manually ?
the ones I followed were [URL] which look very similar. after I mounted it, the mounted home was still empty. but the .Private def has stuff in it
.  looks pretty similar. darn ... can anyone else take alook here? I thought my loopaes experience might help ... but this looks quite different
what happened was I originally had encryption installed. Then I disabled it somehow (I believe by editing some settings file, but I forget what). I then copied my files over to a clean home folder (with no .Private) , and all was good for a few weeks. Then last night, ubuntu did an update and I think overwrote a settings file and this morning, when I turned the machien on, no home folder but a .private folder
I'd try using a livecd to check the home partition directly, without ubuntu trying to mount the encrypted stuff. perhaps something got mixed up there. just a shot in the dark though ..
you can see the remote terminal from where you are sitting, and dont want to reach for its keyboard or what?
my daughter is using the desktop. i want to use it for bittorrent and some other stuff while she's using it. i'm on my laptop with wireless and a smaller disk. and dont want to use BT on the laptop
you can ssh -X remotemachine and run an app - it will appear locally.
seems a *little* slow, but nothing too bad... i think my best (observed) results are around 6 MB/s, but copying only 300 GB (on identical 500 GB drives).  also, that was almost all large contiguous files (typically at least 150 MB)
what's the best app to use when doing these kind of large "backups"?
not sure, because so far i've generally just copied the entire volume with dd, or a partitioning program (i even tried just a straight 'cp', but that was painfully slow)
you'd have to restart if you are that user. I think you can get away with restarting gdm.
how can i restart gdm?
sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart.
thanks
you'll be logged out.

meta packages are good during upgrade period, to make sure nothing is left back
if one of your computers has a gigabit adapter then you can use a patch cable to connect them if not then you will need a hub or a switch
suddenly ? was working before ?
correct. Since perhaps a few days ago when I used it last. Only thing I've changed is I let the updater run like I do most every day.
replug firmly the cables ?
It's a DVI/VGA adapter. it's been working for 2 years, and suddenly today booting up, it refuses to allow me to set to the proper resolution in the Display settings.
uname -r ?
the same way you make sure that your primary network card runs at startup
tried that, doing nothing dosent work ;)
I didn't say to do nothing.  you didn't "do nothing" about your other network card. The fact that the install program did it for you doesn't make any difference
Are you on 9.10 ?.  You there?
usually that's because there is an auto-restart in one of the init files
apt-get dist-upgrade works fine
did you to an apt-get autoremove ?. do*
you might simply "cat" them together (cat file2.wav >>file1.wav), though it might need some clearing up with sox or something.  and it might not work at all

Ctrl+Alt+F2 ??
love you!
no problem :)
trying to recover some data from an old hard disk ;S
you can also try out Ctlr+Alt+Fn | n >= 2, n < 6
not a problem, that works fine!
[URL] ... might be helpful. Had used it a few years ago
probably you :) Can you say what issue you are having?
Devish, is the data all in ine folder?
yes in one folder
you wanna do it via command line, i understand, isn't it?
yes i would be easier that way
and you wanna move the entire folder?
I used Knoppix (qtparted)
was it mounted before?
yes
do you know the address it was mounted to?
yes
what is the command you're trying - or did it not mount at boot time
not mount at boot time..
open the file /etc/fstab and see if the partition is listed there please :)
according to your description, it seems like windows did that thing.  oops sorry misread.  I use an atheros card too. do you use the network manager?
yes, it vanished from there
is it enabled in System> administration > network?
have you run `sudo apt-get update` and upgrade?
did you run restricted drivers thing ?
extract them into new directory and read README
what kind of problems ?
sometimes it doesn't run in gui (but create all the process it usually create), but worst, it slows the computer I use to works (that have a SSD !), and when I say "slows", that mean I need to reboot. Using chromium fixes everything, but why chrome for ubuntu exists if it's not compatible ? I have this problems on both of my computers.
That is strange .
that's why i'm here ^^
lol. But chromium works...... What version of Chrome are you running, i assume the newest?
you can with a live usb but not cd
do you know the /dev/ location of your drive? Like /dev/sdb1
what were you doing in nautilus at the time it crashed?
I dropped images in the folder.
and the bug is reproducible?
I don't know, but when I paste stuff also crashes.
you might have to downgrade, but did the problem start immediately after upgrading to Ibex?
yes.  I'll change to dolphin then ]:).
then i'd have a look to see if a bug has been filed, although i haven't heard of anything like that biting a lot of people. you might be stuck going back to the earlier version..  dolphin?
Did you try kill -9?
have you tried doing what it says?
what's the problem?
lspci tells me matrox graphics mga g400/g450.  and resolution is pretty low
have you been in hardware drivers? syatem > administaration > hardware drivers
no proprietary drivers for this system
ok how old is the computer?
the computer is not very old, just made the mistake to switch my geforce card with this junk
with what junk?
it is, usually, the one you feel better with. Keep in mind that UBuntu relies on Debian (and many Debian devs are Ubuntu devs, and vice-versa)
formatting as ext4 makes it create a lost-and-found directory.  lost+found
how do I format it - it says Lost+found and I do not have permission to use it
if the only thing on the drive is a "Lost+found" directory then everything is correct.  it has been formatted
just wait a little until the disk is snced again. or, if you want to enforce it you can use the sysrq key or simple reboot.
I don't want to reboot, so I'll wait then. Thanks
try pressing ALT + SYS-RQ + S
alt+sysrq gives me a screenshot
not alt+print
This is a support channel. For silly talk go to #ubuntu-offtopic

but i donno. err. trie dloads of dirs. shall i pastebin?. !pastebin
aren't you installing it to a single dir?
do you have ati card or dual card ati and intel?
do you use a seperate router?
no router. just modem. for adsl i configured it with pppoeconfig
wired or wireless
what do i do to configure cable internet connection. wire
you running dual boot at all?
intead of pppoeconfig i need to use some other command. ????. no. just ubuntu. dude cable modem in ubuntu. dont know how to configure the connection. pls help
you should be able to hook it up to your eth0, log into the modem, and configure that according to your ISP's specs
they dont support linux. they r dumb
that's why I asked if you ran dual boot ;)
no. just ubuntu
tell them you need to do a 'manual setup'
they dont even know what linux is. i m telling u. isnt there a command like the pppoeconfig just for cable modems?
with the cable modem configured, Ubunto should see the net connection on eth0 and configure itself automagically
aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
especially if you set it to use DHCP
rpmforge is for redhat - not ubuntu, so it's not a valid question
I said rpmforge-like
what package do you want, as in ubuntu there is no need for rpmforge type repos as the official ones pretty much cover it
python 2.7.2
what version of ubuntu
10.0.4. 10.04. I can build from source
python 2.6 is critical to ubuntu 10.04 - changing/upgrading it is not advised, hence no package for it
depends, try us?
cool, thanks. when I go "curl [URL]" I get connection refused on localhost port 8080. also get connection refused when using python's request lib
see if the http_proxy env var is set, 'echo $http_proxy'

doesn't nautilus show file sizes?
no  i don't think so but i am using ubuntu as of just few hours :)
well where do you want it to display the file size?
everything except the foot and about can be edited at applications:///
thanks! i wish i could just type that into the run dialog :-x
in the run dialog do "nautilus applications:///"
woohoo! thanks!!!
it's too bad that right-clicking on the menubar applet doesn't bring up a link to applications:/// -- would be handy
that let's me edit the applications folder but i'm more interested in editing the other itmes... like remove "Search for Files...", "Recent Documents", and "Take Screenshot"
that's exactly right... I think you're stuck with those those

oh ok

grub error 15 ? re-install grub from a live cd
>live CD. Don't have that or a CD ROM. I dl'd it all
usb ?
idk why that'd be necessary, it clais it can do it from C: just the same. *claims. But I did that. Here's what google turned up: [URL]
what claims can do what from c: ?
Install Ubuntu. Let me find the name of it. I think it's Unetbtin,
so again, can that box boot from usb ?
It can, but I think it's unnecessary. I don't have an extra flashdrive to spare for this. UNetbootin is its full name
if you need to repair grub, you have to chroot from another sys, the tut you gave is from 2009, grub1, now grub2 is in use.  unetbootin is a tool to boot from usb, yes.  so if you can't boot a cd, you can make a bootable flashdrive, and with c: I assume you talk from a windows box, wherefor unetbootin is also available
Well, I've uninstalled and reinstalled it before,  and that didn't help. ya that's what I'm trying to do
lil' confusing, you in first hand wanted just an usb install ?
keyseir: type of sound card, setup?
"02:0a.1 Input device controller: Creative Labs SB Live! MIDI/Game Port (rev 05)"
keyseir: are you using the digital output on the card?
It worked fine before I reinstalled edgy, but now I'm not getting any sound..  Digital output?
keyseir: single cable going from sound card to an amp of sorts, then to a bunch of speakers
No. I've only got it hooked up to a set of speakers... and I've checked the speakers
keyseir: i ask because I had that same exact problem. just had to enable digital output heh
check that you have it all set up correctly?
i enabled it on kmix. what other should i set up?
are there any switches that might be off? Is it plugged in the right spot?.  is the mic still muted?
yeah i think so *checking is it plugged on the comp" no it's not muted. but it just not works!
does it definitely work?
yes, it works on winboze, but not on linux
I would think it would be something quite simple then.  if its functioning in windows it should function in linux
don't you get the option to login to the wayland session, does it fail or what happens?
Its just that wayland crashes and bring me back to GDM, the login screen.. COmmand line is fine. Xorg i fine..  wayland crashes.
i don't know where wayland errors are logged, tbh, have you tried looking at logs?
dusasse: I am quite lost. Nothing obvious in the logs, nothing in /var/crashes
i don't know what else to suggest, sorry. what kind of gpu and which driver is this on?
I am not such, it is a 2012 Mac Mini with a 4K screen, which I guess is a but unusual..  *sure.  FOUND some interestiung stuff in syslog: "[URL]sktop[1789]: Cannot open display:"
they use amd gpus afaik, so probably the radeon driver. you can check with 'lspci -k', check 'kernel driver in use' under VGA controller
the display has no name.  i915
ok, so intel, not amd
It worked for a few days when artful was new, and then it stopped. Wierd.
could be a driver regression, hard to say
After a good few failure messages, it goes "gnome-session-binary[1734]: CRITICAL: We failed, but the fail whale is dead. Sorry....".  Can this be of interest? "udev-acl.ck[1728]: g_slice_set_config: assertion 'sys_page_size == 0' failed" ?
some posts i found online seem to indicate this could be a problem in gdm or gnome-settings-daemon....  you could file a bug against gnome-settings-daemon, since that's what throws the "cannot open display" error
The first "cannot open display" is from gnome-screensav, actually.
so, it could be gdm that fails to start wayland. i'm just guessing, though.
should I throw the log onto termbin for you to see?.  look here: [URL]  What about THIS during boot? : "[ 17.542201] wl: module verification failed: signature and/or required key missing - tainting kernel" ???
that must be some other module, do you have something that uses dkms installed? what about those .bashrc errors near the top of the log, are there any problems with parsing that?
it is PulseAudio.
so if there's no daemon running, how are these apps still making sounds?
try running it in the console manually..  like I do know
yeah, that works. I can then control volume, etc. I'm just surprised that the apps were still able to play sounds without the daemon running. what is pulseaudio's equivalent of /dev/dsp, if there is one?
we still have alsa!.  none.
so they fall back to alsa if pulse isn't running?
sure.
It should already by default
i installed minimal ubuntu
Do you have nm-applet and NetworkManager running?
how do i knw if i have both running?. i have nm-connection in zombie mode
Check the output of ps ax. You can use grep to narrow it down, for example: ps ax|grep NetworkManager
nm-applet sleeping
Does iwconfig show an interface for your wifi card?
22758 pts/0 S+ 0:00 grep --color=auto NetworkManager.  this is my wifi eth1 IEEE 802.11bg ESSID:"punk". it found it as eth1 instead of wlan0
You can do this: sudo iwlist eth1 scan|grep -i essid.  That means NetworkManager is not running. You could try starting it but it may interfere or not work
it's /etc/hosts

It will be automatically used by any programs that need it, such as Xine, .. It's just a library.
You have very large files taking up your disk space.
why would then du -sh show just show actual disk space usage?. I did du -sh /
Is it not the same as df's result?
nope. That's what I can't understand. I don't know maybe possible disk failure?
You may have a file that has been deleted, but still exists on your system. Run "sudo lsof | grep -i delete".  And pastebin the output for us.
read only even for yourself?
yes
chmod a-r file
ty :)
oh no wait
not usually
like what?
you use sudo to get temporary root privileges
log in on a console (Ctrl-Alt-F1), run 'sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/Xorg /etc/X11/X ; sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart'
I don't have to do the restart, X and gdm can't start. Using kdm btw. But, okay, thanks :)
who said anything about restart?.  have you relinked Xorg?
Doesn't /etc/init.d/gdm restart' reboot?
no, it doesn't. Have you fixed it?
Relinked? Please come again.. Thanks so much for the help!. No, not yet. I have to get all the help I can get and go 7 floors up to my computer and try to fix it
switch to a text console to login, bypassing X, which doesn't work. To do this, hit Ctrl-Alt-F1
Ok
log in with your username and password. Then type 'sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/Xorg /etc/X11/X'. Then type 'sudo /etc/init.d/kdm restart'
do you use over 3gb of ram?
SATA or IDE?
ide
did you set the jumpers?
look into 'disks' for smart info, but not all usb controllers pass-through smart info :-(
Disk is OK, 2 bad sectors (23 <unconvertable> C / 73 <unconvertable> F) - Is this it?
jups
The 2 bad sectors can make the files not show up? Will fscking it do the trick?
depends where, if they are in the mbr, you have a problem
ntfsfix was clean - NTFS partition /dev/sda1 was processed successfully- Still the disk only shows the trash dir... Advice?
maybe the files are just deleted , do they appear in your trashcan?
right clin on the panel - add - gnome menu
looks like a bunch of stuff isn't included
ask your Q..
boot into recovery and run the following to clean out old packages: sudo apt-get clean
linuxdcpp
type dpkg -l | grep grub
Thanks, I have the output of that, I don't know what I am looking at/for should i pastbin it for you?
ok
[URL]
ok, type dpkg -l | awk '$2 ~ /grub/ {print$2}' | xargs sudo apt-get -y install --reinstall
Show us..  df
[URL]
And that is the output of what command?
forward port 5900 in your router settings to your PC.  then use realvnc or vncviewer to connect from work to your IP
I believe x3100 is blacklisted due to the problem with video playback when compiz is enabled
so i can not work with compiz
you can still run it.  but its not gonna be all that stable.  hang on
ok
here try running it as follows from a terminal compiz SKIP_CHECKS=yes
i belive k3b can burn cue/bin files
there's been five of them already. (all alpha)
define breaks
<> if i click on the clock to bring up the calendar it totaly freezez both panels
ok thats more info which is good
<> they arent entirely frozen, like they will blink if something makes a change, but i cant click them
i dont use it but i'll have awebsearch
<> and i really enjoy having a clock
you running beryl or any other nonesense like compiz
what's the reponse to #mount /dev/???.  also can you pastebin the relvent lines from lusb?
i have a p5b but i bought a p5ql for one of my kids
and do you know how to enable the sound?
i don't know what she did other than set everything to default (pulse) i think and she has no problems. !ru
strange..
she does have 8.04 not 8.10
and probably x32
yes
then i'll do it without any sound, I don't want to switch to x32
i warned her about 64 bits...i've seen a lot of people complaining
i am prime searching, my 4 cores always 100%, x32 is not string enough$
she doesn't do anything heavy..not needed
you do. what command did you use to mount it?
mate , you cant mount something that isnt in /dev/ and hda1 or hda2 are simply not there
didn't fdisk -l just show them?
it did, which puzzles me.
maybe it's a udev thing
chown youruser:youruser .Xauthority.  you will need to sudo that, I expect
Doesn't exist
it does : ~/.Xauthority.  it's in your home dir ( note the dot)
ls -a doesn't show it.  My bad, damn caps
ls -al ~/.Xauthority. it probably has root:root currently
done it, says it's mine, still nothing
ls -al .ICEauthority
also mine
and you still get that error?
the app or the livecd?
the app. whether I open via gui, terminal, you name it.
what are you trying to do ?
well, I'm trying to open gparted....... that;s it. just open it.. I want to launch gparted and utilize it.. it seems to be random. I shouldnt have to use a livecd to format a flash drive. I just shouldnt
you can't resize or do much with it on the drive you're using ,
I really hate to sound like this, but what is it thats misunderstood? I'm trying to OPEN gparted. Period..  I know what I'm doing from there. I just need to open it.
didn't mean to insult your knowledge , but we get lots of ppl trying partiton a mounted disc. maybe purge gparted and reinstall it
that is the standard on ubuntu and debian. scripts are dash. user terminals are bash
wmii-2 isn't.  i do alot of work in gimp on wmii-2, although i do think it needs an 'always on top' method.
I'm not sure how you'd go about doing that as I've never had to do it personally.  [URL]
it's fake.  your LSI pci card may not be though
I don't have the pci card, I want a sata raid, and the mobo manual actually says that the PCI card is only for SAS raid and that the mobo should be used for SATA raid.  still sure it's fake raid?
yup
can you please tell me why? :0

Are you talking about the Full Circle Magazine issues?
yes
They used to have a script that you could run. it would check on a regular basis, and download the issue (and/or podcasts). If they're still using it, it's on their site or listed in the beginning of the magazine.
- only using compiz-fusion
never open any documents?
LOL.  So you really don't have an answer?
I lookd but cant seem to find any place where its storing that information
It's been driving me nuts since install.
if your in unity, try switching to clasic and clearing it out the old fashioned way
I didn't like Unity so I switched back to classic. It doesn't work like it used to
gnome3 here :) I have no idea
Is gnome3 working?
its unsupported
Ok, I may try it on my test laptop. I don't like Unity at all
I installed with debootstrap and installed from a ppa, avoiding installing unity and gnome all together
use imagemagick ?.  cd directory ; for f in *.png; do convert "$f" "${f%.png}".jpeg; done.  check manpage for more options if you need them
bashscript?
bash command line
i get a permission denied.  can i do sudo cd directory ; for f in *.png; do convert "$f" "${f%.png}".jpeg; done ?
do you have writte permissions on the directory ?
no i dont. its in /var/www
where is this dir located?.  you can not do <unconvertable> sudo cd <unconvertable> cd is not a command. nor is for.  do <unconvertable> sudo -i <unconvertable> and use that shell
mm ok, so what is the final command?
do <unconvertable> sudo -i <unconvertable> and then in that shell <unconvertable> cd directory ; for f in *.png; do convert "$f" "${f%.png}".jpeg; done <unconvertable>
fresh install with separate /home partition
What graphics card do you have?
For what?
password management
Thats what Lastpass is for - not what a Yubikey is for.
on what ubuntu version?>
what version of ubuntu are you using ?
just a second.  10.04 lucis. *lucid
!info httpd lucid. !info apache2 lucid.  so the user running the webserver, is that www-data (I can't remember without checking)
in what way?
uplaod music to my phone
i use banshee with my ipod, but it makes it so it won't work with itunes anymore. you might not want to mess with your iphone because it could become bricked
perhaps you should ask that question in a more python-related channel.. isn't there a #Python on this network?
does not matter only diffrence is the set of defult packages.  and server normaly has no ui included
i know that but i'm making script to install ffmpeg & node.js so enduser can easily install this packages and as per ffmpeg guide they have some different packages for the server and desktop so i'm thinking to install only needed packages for the servers and desktop
the user cant run apt-get install ffmpeg?
we needed some custom features not all the features of ffmpeg so i needed those features only
will just do uname -a.  it will tell you if you have the sever or genrec kernel.  if you have unity there probly desktops
what are you doing on the remote system?.  what OS is the client and the server?
Server is Ubuntu 13.10 and client is Win 7
what do you do on the remote system?
Server is Ubuntu 13.10 and client is Win 7
why do you connect using VNC? What do you do on the remote system?
No terminal access, just GUI atm..  It's just so I can manage it without having to be in the same building as it, it's over a gigabit network (With over 500mbps throughput) and it's performance is very poor.
manage in what way? Updates?
Updates, ensure Web server is still on..  And just generally change settings and config the machine - kind of just doing everything.
you can run updates using apt-get in a terminal. Youan check web pages are up by connecting to it from the windows pc..  all can be done over ssh, much faster
When you click in a flash movie settings pop up. Try adjusting them
> i just get the "enable hardware acceleration option" were other options supposed to have been there?
let me try. What website are you having trouble with?
use mp3burn
ive converted and burned at least 3 cd's, the same exact way. never had any problems. mp3burn doesn't like me
why ?
what language do you want to program in
i think c?
IceCrew, ruby, python, c?. IceCrew, well if you plan to submit packages to ubuntu, canonical prefers you submit python based packages
is python difficult?
IceCrew, not nearly as difficult as C. IceCrew, and in that case you just need the pythong gtk bindings
dozens of IDE's and text editors out for that. !info geany | Haseo.  see 'geany'
Dr-Willis: yeah haha i was wondering if one stood out as the best. i saw a bunch
it all depends on yur needs and the details
something that will be simple and clean, i just use c++ for my programming classes
a little vague.. try geany i guess...
yup
using what program'
depends on the application? I only used file-transfer with my mobile-phone.
im trying to connect my mobile phone to
What do you want to do with the connection?
look up iwconfig
start over, use checkinstall this time. it will make a .deb package
>> Huh?. >> re-make it?
install the package called "checkinstall" and run it instead of "sudo make install" when you recompile it
>> sudo spt-get checkinstall?
sudo aptitude -y install checkinstall
>> What the heck is "sudo aptitude -y install checkinstall" doing in Intrepid?
what do you mean? that installs checkinstall
are you using Skype by any chance??
no
any other multimedia apps runing evan a web based audio plugin?
nope
onboard audio card or add in audio card?
onboard
only one audio card no addins aside from onboard?
right
what about a VOIP add in (usb or ethernet ip phone?)
nothing like that
what version of ubuntu?
dapper
was the sound initialized with the live cd and after install did it function?
enable multiverse repo
i did :(
yes
what game? start game with specified x screen size
I just use VNC.
if I remember correctly there is a build in one in ubuntu however I don't recall the name?
vinagre
is this on a macbook?
no, dell laptop
ah but that's a bit different. my issue is cross-OS, sleeps in one, resumes into a different one
that's an almost funny problem
I know :P. But I'm guessing the issue is somewhere on the boot record? idk, I have deactivated hibernation in Ubuntu, and on OS X it just does it by itself after a few hours on battery
i'm sure you can disable it in OSX as well.  but that's just a bandais
yeah that's the issue, if I don't use it for a few hours, I loose all my open tabs and stuff, I have to reboot it and work without internet
in the meantime though you can certainly disable hibernation in OSX and you can at least keep your work
no work is fine, it reopens automatically, but I usually have 100+ tabs or so open and I can't always open them when I'm away from home. but the bigger issue is that it does it in the first place
which model?
dont use them, use the ubuntu package
I can't enable coolbits with the ubuntu package no matter what I do
okidoki
whats a desktop-effects from bash? bash creates somekind of graphics?
what cpu grunt do you have?
i have a intel core 2 duo 2Ghz. pavilion dv6 1330sf
10% is pretty reasonable, is it full screen?
no it does nothing : just waits for hotkey to call him for a screen capture. it should be 0% . (or about). imho
never going to happen, its high data to capture the screen in real tine and spit it to a file. Think about what is happening and the data size etc. Think about what is happening.  its a seriously data intensive action
jeez
?
not unless you have to
what happens if I delete it?
why do you want to remove the log file?.  you lose information about your system
thats OK, but it doesnt break anything if I delete it?. I want to remove it because it is 396MB big
repeat; why? :-)
^^
sounds like you maybe need 'logrotate' ?

ty checking that out.  404
ubuntu geek gives pretty decent advice.  google search for: add to gnome menu and hit i'm feeling lucky
ty. interesting that accessing it that way works better than from the System > Preferences > Main Menu item. that seems buggy.  i take it back. neither work. keeps unchecking Debian menu
weird.  i dont use metacity so couldnt comment personally
overheating?
that might be a bit too specialized for this chatroom
you could add yourself to the group 'disk'.  that would be a security problem though, you'd be able to e.g. zero-write your disks accidently.
hawke u mean i could type wrong command for say like fdisk -and-fuck-it-up ?
exactly..  you could also add to /etc/sudoers:  root = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/hddtemp
hawke, can i create a script? that i can /exec -o to? and script does a sudo with password and voila?
the above-suggested method seems the best to me.
sandbox what
<unconvertable> : Let's start by taking a look at things from Firefox's point of view.
ok, what do i do?
<unconvertable>  First, type about:config into firefox.
alright
<unconvertable>  In the filter, type plugin_expose_full_path or something like that.. <unconvertable>  When you find it, double click it to make it true.
i searched "plugin_expose_full_path" and got nothing
<unconvertable>  k, then just search for fullpath
its set to false
<unconvertable>  double click it to set to true
lol did you delete it now or what?
do you have a swap partition / file?
welcome to my world.... same here
NOO!!!!!. :).  did that work?
what?
it might still be mounted somehow... have you tried using gparted from a livecd ? just my 2 cents. i'm pretty sure you can get gparted on a livecd, if not I know puppy linux has it by default. if it is, an ubuntu livecd would work for this too haha
1 its very mature 2. its damn fast 3. we live in a multi media world now
the signal is around 50%, the same as in XP. I never had any problems there
hmm. you completely lose connection? or the download stops?
the thing is, it will be fine as long as im not downloading something with a lot of bandwidth, a torrent say, or running a big update. i lose connection completely, and i cant get it back unless i restart
is that the windows one?
not to me
does this mean it doesn't recognize my card? Its a DWL-G520, supposedly supported by 6.10
if it is a wireless card, it looks like it is detected..  the unknown device is just theat unknown
okay. but the unkown device has grabbed the device name wifi0. So, when I try to set up my wifi in the networking app, it's setting it up for wifi0 (the unknown device)
does it just list the unknown device, or does it list other devices in iwconfig?
it lists two devices in iwconfig: the unknown one, and the WLAN one (wifi0 and ath0, respectively)
I'd try to work with the ath0 one then, and see what happens
Okay. I don't know how to set up the network using command line arguments, so I tried the networking connections tool.
are you using a encrypted network?
yes
ahh, well iwconfig is not hard to use, just man iwconfig.  you have to sudo the commands though
okay. I'll give it a try.
the problem could be the "password" thing you may have to type in the long code to get it working in linux
yeah, I've done that..  how do I attach the wireless networking extensions to the device? It says they are attached to the unknown device, but not the WLAN device.
humm, that is weird, I have no answer for it
okay. Do you know how to manually set the logical names? I would like to just switch the logical names and see if that helps.
humm interesting idea.  is this a PCcard, usb or what?
try adding pre-up sleep 5 to ifconfig
Add? How?
Find the part in /etc/network/interfaces for your card then add 'pre-up sleep 5' directly underneath it (will be something similar to 'iface ath0 inet dhcp' (won't work if you use network manager)
you need to add yourself to the fuse group
how do i add myself to the fuse group
prefs, users and groups
I believe puTTY is for that
I can get puTTY to work for command line functions, but not for X apps
how are you accessing the cmd line?
ssh session
put ssh -X <user@address>.  put ssh -X <user@address>
it does not allow that. It starts up with a gui interface.
I'm just guessing with what I do with my Linux boxen
yup, got you.  me too
lol. doesnt it say on their site?
not really
useful...
I'm sure there is a way. It does have a place for a display location.  I have no idea what that means
i know my mum's laptop uses puTTY somewhere and she receives graphival apps across the internet. although they're both running Windows
you'd need to check your apache conf
wget [URL]
go to the advanced tab in firefox preferences
ok
go under encryption, and make sure "Use SSL 3.0" and "Use TLS 1.0" are checked
-> correct
try to play them using mplayer or vlc from the commandline
sudo lshw -C video
once i know the driver, how do i update it?
have you looked at System>Administration>Hardware Drivers?
you can update from there?
are there restricted drivers there that are not enabled?
In the link you posted, it has step by step instructions on what to do
why not make a quicklist for that ?
What does 'lspci | grep -i audio' return in a terminal?
@ - qry=
huh?
did you verify the media?
which media? the cd?
lrojas: well reboot and give that a try that should reinstall whatever the restricted manager was doing..  yes. lrojas: if not you can try removing that package
any will come through a standard update.. nothing to change
you didn't install php
its to do with pointers and types
did sensors-detect tell you which modules to load?
You can use xdm if you want..  and there's startx available..  install the xinit package if you want it
is flashplugin-nonfree installed?
you'd need nautilus for that
try sudo rmmod pcspkr before shutting down
what version of ubuntu?
what about sudo aptitude show banshee.
typically you just run it by typing java -jar foo.jar
go to System-pref-> screen res
boot up and run check disk for erros. then you'll know. *errors*
can i check while im on the pc now that grub should come up?. grub customizer is what i use now
nope. boot the usb. there error checking option is available once booted.
right, i mean the PCs grub i dont know if it got touched, and I have no other way to boot, its a USB based pc. so Im here now before that happens, finding a way to reinstall grub now.... Grub customizer works right?
i must have misunderstood. I thought you said you were making a usb and got some kind of grub messag at the end of creation. that would refer to the usb NOT to your installed system
God i hope not....  why do you ask?
if you use the newest driver 8.42.3 you dont need xgl, its much better
it happens
try changing your window-manager or window-decorator, just to discard an issue on them
I will try that now brb.  nope same thing happens ...
brb, going to take that cable off that computer.... i barely believe the ubuntu cerom is failing that bad... any known issue on the 10.10 installer?.  using compiz? install compiz fusuion icon and use it to fast change between window-managers and test that
ok I will try that brb
i had that issue once, but it just dissapeared by itself
Have you changed your sources list.. what is the exact error it gives
do you mean a compiler?
mostly works for me
take a look at lsusb to get the id and find the driver by id?.  maybe lspci instead for pci id
how did you try to write it ?
You want your home in a partition right?
other audio does?
ya you can do that..
hmmn, how? o.O what do I need?
google :)
what does it tell you when you do a iwlist wlan0 scan ?. paper or plastic ? :)
Interface doesn't support scanning..  wlan0 nor ath0
oh yeah you said only wired not wireless anymore...try to reload the drivers for your wifi
you'll need to provide more detail. What application? Or is it system-wide perhaps? Basically, how do you know there's a memleak?
free99. it's minecraft is the only thing i have running
so it's running on... openjdk or something right? Sorry I don't know a lot about minecraft
system is a proliant server ml110 g6. yea. jdk headless
well... how do you know there's a leak? System eventually starts saying it's out of memory?
yes. looking at the logs. i see that a memory leak is detected before it has a kernal panic
if you can get some of the logs on pastebin I might be able to uncover something. make sure whatever you're pasting doesn't have sensitive info in it though. p.s. can someone help me with my kernel issue?
[URL] free99. there u go i took the last bit of the log
Lets start with the basics, you have a minecraft install from ubuntu repos or somewhere else?
Redirects here. Lucid isn't ready for testing yet.
What do you mean by directory? Are you looking to add an alias or just list them?
sudo umount /dev/sdz500, no?
and as user?
Uuuuuuh... Not sure how nautilus really mounts devices nowadays....  As far as I recall, right-click the device in Nautilus and choose "Unmount"
The context menu in Nautilus only offers something Id translate to eject and <unconvertable> remove safely.
Eh... Well... uh... Try them both and see which it is
Already did that. And then the device node /dev/sdX was gone..  In both cases.
Weird nautilus is weird. I suggest you use "pmount" to mount devices as an unpriveleged user, it seems to work nicely and at least makes sense
this is support, you would get opinions not really worth much as opinions are
well at the very least do you know which on has better support. I hear currently nvidia has better drivers upport BUT AMD is workingto provide oprnsource drivers?
Not really, I just use my computers for basic stuff.
ah
college papers email surfing the web irc is about it
i wouldn't.
and did you log back in after adding yourself to www-data?
logout and back ip? no. in*
that recognises the group change
ok i will try that now thanks again
so you are still not in the groups you added ('groups' will confirm this)
i can see my self in those goups
can you post your groups output, and the output of ls -la /var/www to pastebin?
I get that error too when typing "modprobe snd_seq_oss", that is normal
how can i get it working?
looks like you are using an old tutorial. What are exactly trying to do?
install tuxguitar
installing it or using it?
install then use.  if i start it i get /dev/sequencer: No such file or directory
I get the same error, its irrelevant. Could it be, that tuxguitar is working properly but you just don't get sound?
well, the whole point of tuxguitar is to get sound, otherwise it's useless, every once in a while instalation succeds and i get working sound but i don't know why it wont work now.  i'm pretty sure it has something to do with the missing modules
I dont think so, that issue is usual and also happens to me on every new computer. Start tuxguitar, go in the tuxguitar settings and tell me your settings under "Sound"
tuxguitar sequencer (should have real sequencer in there), midi through port (should have java sequencer in there)
"should have"? you are confusing me
when tuxguitar works, those options are available, the java sound sequencer is included in the installation files, if i run the exact same binaries in puppy linux the real time and java options are available
so you can't even start tuxguitar?
i can, but the sound doesn't work
so "tuxguitar-jsa" is installed? Under Midi Port I got the option "Gervill" (I think thats the java thing) which is working fine
gervill is not java sound sequencer.  and i don't even have gervil on my installation
so? I don't have any package called Gervill too, but it is working
i found gervil but if i run it i get error "midi system unavailable".  [URL]und.midi.MidiUnavailableException: Can not open line
what tuxguitar version are you using? would it be an option to you to run tuxguitar over wine?
to play amr files you have to enable medibuntu repository...
if gaim has the focus you can press alt f5
Gui? Add german layout andmake it default. Is it natty?
snd_hda_intel? It seems like there are issues a'plenty with that module.. At least I know _I_ have issues.
no, its a nvidia based laptop
The SOUND chip.
nvidia + amd. oh um
If it's an HD Audio, it'll be snd-hda-intel -- Intel made the HD Audio standard.
do you mean net radio streams and such, or what sort of files?
maybe it's a CDR ?
frogz: haha.. nah in windows it works fine..
can you read from the dvd: sudo dd if=/dev/hd# of=/dev/null bs=10000 count=10
^^
thanks
np, I've spent the last 3 days getting my damned wireless usb device up and running... so lemme know if those aren't helpful
I have airlink that I have never had luck with on linux. it will show the wireless acess points, but never really conect
which one specifically?
it looks like a thumb driver. I will give you the serial number... .  AWLL3026
Have you tried looking up to see if theres a different driver for it?
It shows it on my network settings, how can I tell if it is connected?.  no, I am fairly new with linux
You say you can see wireless networks in your network settings?
wireless connection
The Ubuntu wiki page says it should work out of the box, so, you might want to make sure that when you open 'Network' you enable the wirless device, and disable all others.  'activate' rather
okay, so I will uncheck the wired connection and see if I get a connection
ok.  [URL] <- this might help too if that doesn't work
test. yeah, didnt really work...  where did you see that it would work right out of the box?
see your PM
I can't see a pm
type /msg  test
I don't have a seperate window with you in there .  I am using xchat
In your Networking menu can you see any networks on the drop down list?
no.  No.  I assume you mean the ssid
Have you installed ndiswrapper? Yes I meant the ssid
depends what it is
<unconvertable> is "mol(mac on linux"

lewoco: Are you sure the drive is a burner, are you sure the medium wasn't already burned?
100% sure on both counts. I burnt a CD with the burner half an hour ago using media from the same reel as the current disc in the drive.
lewoco: do you have two drives (maybe it's looking at the other one?)
Only 1 CD drive
lewoco, bad CD?
I tried a second CD, no difference.
lewoco: there is space to write on the HDD (not that it should need it if you're burning an ISO)
what sort of issues?
yes, though suggest kubuntu-desktop instead
I'd recommend looking in System > Administration > Device Manager
check this, check to see if DOS emulation for USB is enabled. mine was and it messed everything up
where can I find that?
in the system BIOS.. has it always done this?
you need to remount it.  or throw it into automounter and have it mounted on demand
but /etc/fstab i mentioned the uuid and location
if it's a san mount. you're going to lose it when you suspend the vm and it comes down. resume won't remount it
ty what about NFS.?
you're going to have the same issue..  [URL]
i need to do manually any option to automate.?.  ty dude. this is the one i am looking for
no problem
if i configure with autofs resume operation also it will mount, whenever i access it
it should..  obviously your network needs to be up and the host available
nice dude and ty.. host means SAN or NFS.?
suspending vm's can be wonky some times though. because the system doesn't really know it was suspended.. the san. you can't suspend. go somewhere else where the san isn't available, resume, and expect it to work
drivers or drives? to show all mounted drives "mount"
mount points
mount points are any directory on your system?
yes - if you install ccsm you can - there is a unity plug in that allows you to hide it by default
try right clicking on the panel and select "Add to panel" and add a Notification area
nothing
hmm.. it feels like such a cheap solution.. but have you tried rebooting?
on Netbook? whats your Wifi chip?
it has worked on this hardware fo the last few releases no problems without any special intervention, usually just works out the box.  yes netbook.....  Network controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL8192E Wireless LAN Controller (rev 01)
are you having Atheros? linux module ath9-? ?k?m ?
not sure what you mean?
type "lsmod" in terminal.  or "lsmod | grep ath"
no ath*
then it looks like a messy driver for wifi in 10.10 like the "ath9", what is your WiFi config? A, B, G?
hmm again, i am unsure what you mean by A, B, G sorry
you have Router with Wi-Fi or Access Point?
yeah
if i apt-get install kubuntu-desktop will kt keep all my icon settings etc.. or is it just better to wipe the partition out and start from kubuntu install ?
I think the kde preferences are mostly independant of the gnome ones
if you are on gnome, double click the network icon on the tray anda window will pop up. Select ppp connection from there and i suppose you know the rest
it is not showing there
does not show ppp connection?? what connections does it have?
its ppp
so you do have ppp! click on it and select Preferences from the button on the side
of course
dropping them from a 60 storey sky-scraper?
What a great idea. SSD cache documentation for bcache is frying my brain. Hence why I'm looking for other solutions
:) ... seriously, what kind of speed do you want that ssd can't provide? put them on a faster controller?
I want better speeds on HDDs but without buying SSDs. Mainly due to the cost difference as my budget is severely limited. Because I have a 128gb RAM machine but HDDs normally would completely die under the load
I have the same here
I use HDDs on a 72gb machine but fear 128gb would just be too far
Well, how about running some stuff from a ramdisk?
I could.. although thing is I ideally need to use all the RAM on the box.
clone the ramdisk from a HDD at boot... sync it back out at shutdown
A RAM disk though obviously uses RAM though doesn't it?
OK, well, fast controllers and multipath disks then
Yeah... As in different RAID options?. E.g. RAID 10?
If you want fast disks, but 10 disks in a stripe_mirror array on fast multi-path controllers
Hmm.. I wouldn't want quite as many as 10 disks as I could just buy SSDs then.. hmm. In reality I only need 2x 1tb hmm
Unless there is a lot of I/O going on, the kernel cache should be quite sufficient
Thing is, there is an awful lot of I/O going on. Lemme get some figures
well, the closer you can get it to the CPU, the better then... I return to ramdisk :).  sounds like you just need to get your head around bcache
Sounds like that to me too..
play with it in a virtual machine config
what was the question?.  what was the question?
unholy, sorry for delay. I want to know if I'll install openVZ on a desktop-ubuntu machine .... others proccess and jobs from it, will continue de run fine?
they will be separate.
I know..
what are you trying to accomplish?
openVZ will don't affect the rest of processes ?. I want to install openVZ to make some virtual machines, but I want to be sure this job doesn't affect the rest of apps which running on my PC
did you read what openVZ (and virtualization in general) is about?
i highly doubt it. elf has been "the way" for like 7 or 8 years now
good, I guess I can disable that in my kernel :D
it's only a few k, not sure why you'd bother
sudo apt-get --reinstall install evolution
that will delete / rewrite all files, including config and so ???
No, your configs are stored in your home directory, APT won't touch them.  Just delete them if they're broken and let evolution recreate them
k, that's what I want ....cause i'm having troubles importing a pst file .... and I think reinstall may solve this .....hopefully ....
Probably not
what is tricky ...every 2 reinstallation of ubuntu evolution works without any problem .....  it did not change a single thing .......  i want to completely purge evolution from Gnome, then reboot, and after that install ...is that possible ???
Well sure, but.  It won't fix anything -_- Reinstalls never fix anything, unless there is some missing file
I usually find that searching 'bash' gets me in the right places when talking about scripts..  i.e. 'bash' in addition to whatever else you're looking for
how are you plugging in the flash memory?
I have some experiences with it, yes.
I'm trying to restore a backup, but it seems to have gotten stuck on "checking for backups"... Either that or I'm being impatient
Hmm. Run htop, see if it's acting up..  This never occured to me. It's very straightforward app.
'htop'?
htop, or Run "ps -aux | grep deja" -- Whatever the dejadup command is.
Ok... What am I looking for?
See if RAM or CPU is really high, that's it..  Are you trying to restore a large backup? If so, that may be the reason.
Doesn't seem so, no
How long have it been?
I'd say... about 25 minutes
Okay. Clearly something happened. It shouldn't really take that long. Different versions?
lsmod | grep hci.  if that lists ehci, you're using 2.0
that should work
what was it?
real
using a monospaced font, right?
yes. on my other vm with 11.10 its no problem though
what do you have set as the system-wde monospace font?. *wide
what services?
I have the family calendar on my machine (.ics files).  everything works fine if I am logged in. I think I just need to have the wireless start on boot. But I don't know how to do that.
you would want to edit your IP table to allow connections from your local network ie: 192.168.x.x and also have the apps loaded into the /etc/init.d or the umm... startup file which i forgot the name of.  the script is /etc/rc.local
thats sounds right. So, I'll read up on init.d, that a start.
that loads apps before you log in.. so it can run your wifi and your calender prog. !rs
your video isnt working
Video is working, rather, I have a problem running quicktime videos: there's no audio
mplayer?
Mplayer..  I tried totem, but I can't stop it from using xv which causes a hard lockup on my system
grab the latest mplayer from source along with the latest codecs
alright
also see if you have any audio playing a dvd, etc.. using mplayer
What are you trying? What error doe you get?
I cant update gdb
So I gathered. Please provide the command used and error message received. Pastebin these.
sounds like a hardware error
as in?
if the box won't boot when the harddrive has power, that sounds like a hardware issue, unless your getting a softare error
what are you trying to do
i downloaded some file and it got saved in archieve manager but i don know how to open it where to search for
what format file, what are you trying to do with it
Without drivers, neither Windows nor Linux woudl detect anything. The drivers are shipped with the default installation most likely.
whats the problem?
have you tried running "nautilus" from a terminal?
I made a script and put it into rc.local.  that is /etc/rc.local
as long as windows pc runs a vnc server, sure
can you tell me a good vnc server name for xp?
tightvnc
try iwconfig
permissions ?
i tried 777 and 755 for whole home dir.  do i need a specific permissions for ftpd to work?
users need to coincide
rDNS should be on?.  it lookups your hostname and checks that the ip is actually the one your connection from. connecting*
but it doenst let me login
it shouldn't be the problem - must be something else..
If i connect to my [URL] it gives the error reverse mapping checking getaddrinfo for stargate.morraye.local [192.168.1.1] failed - POSSIBLE BREAK-IN ATTEMPT!
lol -badass
uname -a
can you get to a terminal and type "dmesg"? might give you a clue
update-rc.d maybe?
export variable.  without the $ sign.
yeah i tried that
Oh. You mean from a script!.  I get it..  You can't. However, if you can run the script in the current shell: . /patch/to/env.sh
yeah the bash file contains 'export THIS_VARIABLE="value"'
Or, well, source /path/to/env.sh
:-/
Instead of running it.
so bash -C "source /path/to/env.sh; echo $THIS_VARIABLE"
Yup.
hmm. thx.  it does not work
[URL]
apt-get -f install might be worth a shot
oh... just type "nvidia-settings".
.. nice.. :).  what does your nvidia-settings says about your graphics processor? .. mine says C51 .. strange..
says GeForce FX 5200, which is what i have
you will have to install your own from [URL]
i installed it via .bin file from Java but it still says update 26
thats because /usr/bin/java is linked to your 26 installed version
ooh. thx
sudo pdate --alternatives --config java
ick  you shoulda asked me to help u set that up first lol.  can you boot into recovery mode
clarify the question please.
we told you when you first asked. yes, since 12.04
but i can't make a live USB on a mac, how can i do it?.  i tried the latest version, but it does not show up on booting
and did you download the mac ISOs? what kind of mac do you have?
i got the ISO from the Ubuntu website, i am not sure if there is a special ISO for mac, my mac is firmware 8,1 macbookpro 2012 and i have OS X 10.9.3
yes there are as i mentioned above earlier ;)
oh, how can i find them?
[URL]  i have no idea what the differences are though
oh.  ok downloading it now.  will come back to you after i try installing it :-)
ok you're holding down 'alt' after the boot chime yeah to select the different device?
yes, previously the live USB does not show up, even after several restarts, will try this ISO file and i will let you know :-)
it's probably how you're creating it then
what type of videos?
sudo modprobe saa7134_alsa
your friend needs to tell ubuntu to set the resolution by his monitor.  it's there in screens and graphics under adimerstration
I've tried changing his monitor to the correct resolution in that, and it works for the login screen, but as soon as he actually logs back on it reverts back to the old 800x600..
well did tell ubuntu to work the correct version of his monitor.  also is you are using the non-restricted drivers that might be the main problem. if*
it should do it on plug in.  it should do it when you plug it in, IF the motherboard supports hot plug
it does support hot plug (ahci) but ubuntu is not showing it
ahci doesn't mean it's hot plug, that's just one option
weird if I hot plug a hard drive it does mount it automaticaly
does your dvd drive have a disk in it
yeap
is the dvd drive hot plug supported
[URL]  but never tried
yes. got it working here
could you offer any advice on how to secure it..?
with ssl - I've found it very good
especially flood controls, etc
not had much in the way of flooding, but overall, not had a problem
alright thanks i will look into it
onething to keep in mind is your maildir format on the imap server squirrel mail is fussy
what do you mean?
check the squirrelmail help but maildir and maildir++ and things like that effect its behaviour, as does the imap server
ok.  would you mind quickly explaining how to enable ssl for squirrelmail
well, there is 2 points, ssl on the imap server and ssl on the apache server, its not really squirrelmail
oh well they both have ssl already. i use webmin which runs with https
ok - so when you configure squirrelmail just tell it to use ssl.  and make sure your ssl domain for webmail is using ssl
thats the part i dont know how to do
which bit
linksys support in linux is almost non existant.  ndiswrapper and windows drivers should get you going
ekiga
Go to your application manager software/sympatic and do a search for gnome and uncheck them to uninstall. Hit apply.. Synaptic*
check the mirrors
how did you install it?
loshki: sudo apt-get install swat
did you do any of the stuff it talks about here? [URL]
DSL. Damn Small Linux. or Feather Linux. google that
DSL? does it have a GUI?
of course!
No need for sudo.  But seriously, if you run just bchunk, you should get quite a lot of output
not all, but most, technically
Like Kdenlive for video editing and pavucontrol and ffmpeg, stuff like that?
what format are you talking about, though? :)
The new Ubuntu package format coming out for 13.10 touch and 14.10 desktop.
the primary limiting factor will be things that aren't readily built on arm.  which is called?
I'm thinking that the user whose homedir that is has to be logged in for the files to be accessible.
I am
Hm, I was pretty sure they got mounted on login.
In fact, that's where I'm running this chat from. sftp works just fine..  They get mounted, but as a FUSE filesystem. The nfs-kernel-server doesn't read it.
Can root see the files? True on my system.
Yes, but not nfs
Oh, no idea then, sorry.
check out the Ubuntu nvidia guy, you have to download two modules. guy=guide
thirste: i only got lynx to browse
hold on a sec then
boot the desktop cd and mount your OS as the partition, then type passwd to change the root password
it depends on which environment the variable needs to be set -- shells? All users? Just one user? Gnome?
all users, i've ssh'd into a test server. as root
so it needs to be set system wide in all shells?
do you get any sound?
> I do, yeah...
System->Preferences->Sound might help
One sec
thank you :)
[URL]  Tell me how that works.
thank you :) trying it now
You will most likely have to reinstall.
it's giving a lot of errors...it didn't find ndiswrapper for example. is that normal?
Lets try another way, go .. System > Administration > hardware drivers
Change the URLs in the clients [URL]st to specifically use the apt-cacher-ng server.
That results in an error, "URL seems to be made for proxy but contains apt-cacher-ng port. Inconsistent apt configuration?"
Chaneg the URLs and dont use Acquire::http::Proxy on the client.
im dealing with mine allday ATI
I tried to install an ATI card, but gave up and am trying to go back to my original "Generic Driver". But I didn't back it up, and now I think I'm screwed.
give me a sec ill get you a link
awesome, thank you
megajuice [URL]
I'm looking at it now
megajuice im finally tripple booting on a 32" lcd sweet
yeah i've looked at that probably 100 times. I need to get the driver for my generic card that I have.
megajuice worked for my onboard ati
yeah I tried to install it, it didn't work, I got pissed off, and I put my old card back in.
megajuice I know the feeling
what card do you have?
megajuice it took me all day to get my 32" lcd working. megajuice onboard radeon express 200 nothing fancy
I've been trying for 3 days. I have a Radeon 9550
megajuice its not easy brother but i think i seen something about your card on that site
probably, I'm gonna keep looking
megajuice ATI is a bitch in IBEX. megajuice are you 32 or 64 bit
Open a terminal and run "irssi".
ARCH=i386 is your problem
What card?
Do you have all the dependancies?
does anyone know how can I link the two files?.  yes it's a simple makefile (3 files, 1 .h and 2 .cc)
you should be fine, unless theres a problem with the code, thats the only thing that your pastebin shows.
sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree
firefishe, I know, I did that, FF isnt recognizing it
stwange
- /var/cache/apt/archives
thanx but i dont find it in there can it be that it has a completely different name?-.-
- what package is is?
what's the issue?
i updated a bunch of stuff and now i get a kernel panic at boot. cannot boot
k. what is the error? cannot mount /. ?. if you press escape and pick a different kernel out of the list, does it work?
no. stuck
what's the error ?. need more info than 'kernel panic'. cuz that can be a lot of things
refresh rate? Or resolution?
refresh rate
what video chip?
its 60hz for the laptop lcd which is too low for a crt ... ie it hurts to look at... its using the savage Xorg driver
is the CRT a clone of the lcd, or a different screen?
all refresh rates are effectively locked. the only time the refresh rate is computed on the fly is if _all_ the modes in your [URL]nf file are invalid.  if all are invalid, it will choose from a small group of defaults.
synaptic (therefore apt-get as well) allows reinstall but i do not think it reinstalls dependencies as well
yeah.. you can add the --reinstall switch to apt-get.. but i think there is something wrong with the dependencies... i can no longer view pdfs with either acroread or evince
if you want to reinstall - i think you will need to march thru them yourself :(
its an attempt at improvement over older sound servers such as arts
try a USB mouse or keyboard? I'm just guessing.
they are USB
ouch, sounds like the USB wasn't properly recognized or, you might prefer to use the (not always present) PS/2 ports. :(.  unplug and replug them? again just guessing. :(
yeah.. the power button doesn't work either (unless i hold it down) im guessing its an HID problem.  they work fine in Intrepid. (on it now)
disable ACPI or is it APIC during install.
did you have an upgrade question about those?
it. it 's very slow
need more details. what is slow exactly
nothing from the windows world except mp3.  and DVD i think
there isnt one
what about System > Administration > Hardware ? Does that work?. hardware drivers*
it just says "No proprietary drivers are in use on this system"
ah, most times that will start the hardware app
what do you mean?
the one you were talking about
in the image for this machine i installed nvidia-93 manually.  then i removed it now.  before the last reboot
93? thats a bit new for your card
try with sudo
as far as i know you may only be able to do that in windows unless your bios manufacturer provided linux files to create or run a bios update. this isn't anything ubuntu/linux has control over sadly
, im trying to follow a mix of two tutorials i ve found in the net but unfortunately i dont have the knowledge enough i suppose
link me those tutorials i would like to look them over. a bios update is vendor specific (hp,dell, or mobo manufacturer) so it should be an interesting trick if someone has a workaround
how to I run php from the command line? tell me and i'll do it.  i have it installed, use it to do some web development
Does PHP not have an interactive console like Ruby or Python?
it does, I just don't know how to use it, it's more commonly used to be served from web servers. Although I know you can run it from the command line. I just don't know how.
is that one of those canon monstrosities?
You shouldn't have to. do a locate mplayer and find the files that remain. You could delete them by hand, but I think this is overkill..  please put my nick in when chatting to me, I am using two machines, and I will miss your messages.
thanks a lot.. but i get an error saying mplayer not found when i do.. "sudo apt-get build-dep mplayer. " after i download and configure as per the insns
what version are you trying to compile. For what chip?
i m using a x86 chip.. and i downloaded the latest version of mplayer from the website which was MPlayer v1.0pre7try2.  i m using a x86 chip.. and i downloaded the latest version of mplayer from the website which was MPlayer v1.0pre7try2

start xmessage as the user.
I SSH'd into the machine, and ran xmessage, but it returned "Error: Can't open display:".
then you arent the user you want to message.
Hm, odd. I SSH'd into the box with their login creds.. And they are the only user on the box.
then just set the DISPLAY variable to the running X server.
where are you seeing this?
linux-signed-generic-its-vivid. linux-generic-lts-vivid. linux-virtual-lts-vivid
but what did you do to see this...
during installation on vmware
of what ISO?
i downloaded the iso image. sec
please press enter less
ubuntu 14.04.3-server-amd64
well that likely installed with a 3.19 kernel anyway, but i recall no step where others are chosen - or made to be chosen
i chosen the one is highlighted from the beggining of the opened page. i chose* beginning*
what you just said doesn't make any sense to me
using wine?
crossover office
ah right
so, yes.
You have to pay for that?
in a positive or negative way?
yeah....  does lsmod show speedstep_centrino loaded?
are you sure? check your ~/Pictures/
why exactly are you trying to do this? so you can sync?
No so I can use my PCs internet over a secure VPN while I am out in the city
so you want to connect your ipod touch to your private network from anywhere?
Yes. So my data will be encripted
how woudl you be connecting to this network? through wifi from somewhere?
Yes
wouldn
Over the internet, there are three options in the iposL2TPPPTP IPSec
wouldn't it be not worth your time since you are connecting through random wifi access points anyway?
Looks like somebody upstairs screwed things up :(
[URL]
not much :) It'll appear as a new soundcard, and you just need your software to allow you the choice (or recognise ALSA (or pulse?) settings from the environment).  most of the voip apps let you specify the card you want to use
you can get the old file from your backup. If you don'y have a backup, it is gone
but i didn't created any backup and that was my /etc/hosts file
Well, you'll need to recreate it
no trolling ty :P
dosent eject work in console?
no it keeps insisting something is accessing it, but I know for absolute certain it's not
try losof /dev/cdrom
was that a typo?
yes lsof :)
ahh that's handy, it's saying that an editor I closed 5 minutes ago is still using it

what mouse do you have?
You could disable the scaling ...  Not sure if you actually can make it faster
- try a different harddrive?
Hey guys, Im trying to install Ubuntu on my PC here but on every CD I try i get a bunch of errors along the lines of "Buffer i/o something something SR0" and then it quits with a kernal panic.. what do I do !?.  Sorry the error stated SR0 not HDA1.. that was a mistake :)
- that makes a difference. it would seem to suggest that something is wrong or not cooperating with your cd drive.  -- can you boot into and OS and use the cd drive without problems?
No sir.. I tried the live and alternate CD and both give me these errors when i select either install or boot from CD.  But when I use the CD drive in windows there are no problems at all
- ok - that's what I was looking for - confirmation that the drive works. Did you try burning the cd at a slower speed? I've run into that once or twice, and that 'fixed' it for me...
I have burned it at 8x 4x and even 1x.. all the same problems
- whoa - you're way ahead of me :) That's strange indeed. Are you burning it on the same drive you're reading it from?
No im not. Because for some reason the drive im burning it with does not see the disk as boot disk. So i had to swap it into a DVD drive to boot
- can you swap drives around to try booting the cd from a different one?
Due to powercable shortage i can only have 1 drive on at the same time. So its either the CD-RW drive or DVD drive. When i hook up the CD-RW drive it will not boot into CD at all
- interesting. Are you reseting the jumpers on the back of the drives when you switch them around?
Not at all
- just double check those -- depending on their configuration they may be set to master/slave/cable select and that (maybe?) is causing troubles?
the network manager comes with a simple browser
is that under system->Administration->Network ?
it's the network-icon thingy in the systray.  if I left click on it I see the available wireless networks
hum, I start it and see "network settings" but no where to browse, even after unlocking
is your wireless networking stuff working? I just left-click on that icon and the roll down menu shows the networks.. together with the wire networks.  this is kind of the way it looks, [URL]
ls -l from a terminal or from plain shell
there some places to set it .
yes i know. ive been doing it in hda analyzer. but i dont wanna keep doing it.  i wanna just make a script uppon start up
System-Preferences-Startup Applications . this is one.
do u know anything about the hda-analyzer.diff file? do u think i can make it load upon start up
I am not familiar with that . but as you want to load it upon startup . there are some approach ..  you can write to the /etc/rc.local
because if anyone has any experience in hda analyzer they all know that all the settings will vanish after restart.  i can put the .diff file in their?
you can look that file ,you edit it and write some commands there for the os to run upon startup
yeh but the .diff file has alot of stuff in it lol.. do u need to put any option lines or anything like that in their?
at your case ,maybe you can edit a "patch"command for the .diff file
Know any Patch commands?. !patch
I though , it is one configuration file that will change every time you restart , isn't it? then how about the .diff file .It is diff original-configuration present-configuration?
visual effects can cause issues.. and slow things way down

what makes you think your graphics card is not being recognised
that seems to be normal behaviour. a second wifi card would get a second wireless caption with a own list of ssids
the second wifi card has been removed.  right now I just want to go back to what previously worked, namely the madwifi-hal drivers.
if you have tow, their names are shown. if you have only one, its name is hidden
why not just strip the splash altogether
i don't know what is that but please tell me how and i will do it :D
I mean, just have no graphic, you will get all of the text rolling by but you will be able to see some progress and such if that is your purpose
i don't think i get you very well. my purpose is to fix my ubuntu desktop to can work on it, now is some twisted line grafics ...
but the graphic problem is just the little boot graphic right?
the problem starts since the login screen appears and further when i login too picture is twisted
oh I see, your initial question was unclear. You must have problems with your X configuration.  not sure how ubuntu is dealing with that these days, you could edit /etc/X11/[URL]nf though
i don't have a clue idea what happened, but after normal ubuntu update the picture went to hell
what updated
You'll want to see if you have the NTFS filesystem module installed (I'm on a Windows laptop at the moment, so can't check)..  cat /proc/cpuinfo. whoops, make that /proc/filesystems
k..but i don't need ntfs, just fat 32
Oh, perfect.  Windows on the first partition?
pulseaudio should be able to handle that. just choose the output device accordingly
what do you want to know?
is there any performance increase for a desktop
you're going to hate me, but depends. which raid configuration are you looking at
y would i hate you? what does it depend on?
a lot, thats the problem. Depends on the raid configuration you use, the hardware you have, the speeds of the slowest hard drive
System->Administration->Hardware Drivers. If it's not there it won't be in the kernel..
I can't get my serial card to work. Doesn't load the serial module
What card is it? i.e. Manufacturer etc..
Communication controller: Device 5372:6872 (rev 01),Subsystem: LSI Logic / Symbios Logic Device 0002
Have you tried using manufacturer drivers?
you mean when you are over the taskbar?
yep
move the mouse away from the taskbar? :) personally i love the featrue. i discovered it by mistake. heh
i have a sensitive wheel, so it gets annoying :\
id say right click on the task manager and see what properties it has
you're watching fridge ads?
that's actually kindad funny
the freezing isn't though -- try disabling all plugins/extensions.  usually it's flash that causes hangs
just double click the .deb file from the file manager.  if you are on KDE, you need to click the .deb file
That's quite odd, is this a fresh install, or?
No,  .. But I haven't done anything to cause this, really.
Installed something recently?
Tell us your problems
i have no clue some update crashed my system and i am not able to boot into ubuntustudio12.
Try to detail this a little more, like is there a grub menu, and if so what happens when you try.
in nautlius file manager?
what do you mean "use" it? Write programs that use GTK? Run GTK programs??
i mean to change themes and such...
and you don't have GNOME installed?
The rewrite of GDM doesn't support theming yet.
if the keyboard lights are flasing its a kernel crash. so the system is dead and no more network
is there a log I can look at to see why it happened?
/var/log/messages, though i am not sure it has the actual kernel crash
I looked there, and it shows all of the startup activity from the reboot, but not the actual crash.  Is there any established way to go about troubleshooting this?
maybe the log file was just rotated at the time of reboot, so might have to go back one step in history. just ls -al /var/log/ you will find it
I'll look...
i would say that the display shows a kernel dump, pictures of kernel dumps are ok nowaways.  mythbuntu channel can give you more hints on which log files to check
has your system a name already?.  the machine apache is running on, I mean
yes it does, the name is "LinuxServer"
if you "ping LinuxServer" .. does that work?
ping: unknown host LinuxServer
ok, first of all you need to make an entry in your /etc/hosts file
I have never done that, I beg your batience, can you help me on that?
add a line like this like this: "192.168.1.33 LinuxServer", where the 33 should be your real ip part...
ok, I am trying
sure, use "sudo gedit /etc/hosts" to open the file
ok, done, so I guess I have to restart my networking right?
nope, ping should work now
no it is not
. Ok. Can you ping 192.168.1.x address you said you use?
yes I can, I installed a Apache server to my Ubuntu, everything is working pretty good, however I wonder what should I do in order to access the computer using a human name like "webserver" thatn writing 192.168.1.x ??
i know
sorry, something qrong with the copy/paste.  cmrabet@CM-Laptop:~$ ping 10.10.10.210. PING 10.10.10.210 (10.10.10.210) 56(84) bytes of data.
ok that works?
Iyes, when pinging to the numbered IP it works
ok then you need to put *that* 10.10.10.210 address in /etc/hosts
[URL] that's my hosts file
ok, moment.  ok. First of all, you have a double entry in the /etc/hosts for LinuxServer..  oh, 1 moment.  before you were not able to ping "linuxserver" ? Because before it was on your 127.0.1.1.  let's take one step back :) Edit /etc/hosts and put an "#" before your line starting with 10.10 ...
so shall I delete that line? mas.msft is our domain here
well, that one should work. So disable your [URL] first by inserting # before that line
I have done it, but still the same result, Don't you thinkg that I have to restart the netwroking in my server?
no, that's not necessary.  type "ping 127.0.1.1"
from the server?
yes
pinigint to 127.0.1.1 I get pong
are you talking about more than 1 machine?
yes, I am now in a desktop machine controling the server throught shh
ah.. that explains
There is a reset, however if differs on the ubuntu releases, which are you running?
Yes
?
Check edit: preferences: playback: enable crossfade backend
that's not gapless.
Yes it is, check Rhythmbox docs.  I had the exact same reaction as you, but I read up on it and tadaa, gapless playback
roger. Thanks..  not quite gapless, but closer.
Then it's most likely a problem with the tracks themselves. Most of my music plays back with flawless gapless
Everything will be building from source constantly, like in a Gentoo system. If you can afford the cpu and bandwidth it's not so horrible.
there's a deb on the gizmo website
you need a slip-driver for windows
no.
Ur as clear as mud, is it the Vmachine or the real machine that can't see the drive
it's either. There is an x86 version and a 64-bit version..  it all depends upon which CD you downloaded
use 32 bit x86
can you run glxgears?
what is that ? :) not to literate with all ubuntu specific names :(
try running this script.. it test some stuff for compiz [URL]  hehe.. it's an opengl demo thingy.. some twisting gears in a window
give me a mom, connecting :)
it's just a quick test to see if your video stuff is setup right
ok so just follow on with the commands thats it ?
did glxgears work?. !canonical
gears show fine.  the module just says that it encountered an error checking the memory size, all other things say ok
then try the script from the webpage.. there are instructions there
i already ran that :) thats where the memory error showed up
hmm.. hang on.. let me check something
sure :) im just tryin to figure out what is causin this, because i just had to run recovery and fix some consistency issues (my whole desktop was locked up ( ).  ok i installed nvidia-settings now, and it says all tests [ok]
hmm.. so all settings are ok.. and it's still not working?
nope:(.  all problems started 3 days ago out of nothing
might have been a kernel update.. don't remember when the last one was.  what kind of graphics card?
What happens when you hit Ctrl+Alt+F1?
find -iname "string". but i recommend 'locate "string"'
xemacs ?
myth has their own channel
jack_sparrow: I get an error: Upnp not found, whenever I run the setup. It brings me to a different setupd screen where I put in the user and pass (both correct), it says cannot log into server and loops.
I cant help other than pointing you to a room full of people running mythtv
Have you checked for similar bugs on Launchpad?
add a ";" between commands
so "cd ~/jUploadr-1.1.2-linux-i386; ./jUploadr" should work?.  or can i simplify that?
you could put those commands into a shell script and point the launcher to that
how?
try that combination first before getting into shell scripts, we'll see about later if you heva trouble starting Jloadr deal ?
deal
okay, does it start ?
"Failed to execute child" process "cd" (no such file or directory)"
just to check if i'm with you .. you're trying to run JUploadr from a menu ?
a launcher that i made on the desktop.  a launcher that i made on the desktop
i see, you'll need to re-check your paths in the launcher commands
blender.  type sudo apt-get install blender
i thinks it's a 3d modelling tool
yes, you mean a structured systems analysis tool ?. or a simulator ?
Start by identifying your problems specifically and looking around for bugs in your driver module and then possibly your init system. That's where I would start personally.  Also look in dmesg. It may reveal some information about what's going on.  Also any recent updates
dmseg only states that the link went down. And drivers i suspected as well, looking for some others..  Freshly installed server
does it start at eth0 then go to eth2?
0-3 =)
hmm. Did you change your hostname and reboot since it changed
they have mirrors everywhere, dependent on your physical ip location they redirect you (google)
download it from nvidia's site and install it?
why do you need to do this?
does the program in question provides commandline switches to do that ?
a terminal eg. it always opens in a really small size, starts to be annoying...
compiz has window size hooks in 'place windows' if you use that, or else use an app called devilspie
where do i find this size hook?
in compizconfig-settings-manager it's in 'place windows' (window management section), you will need to enter a hook like the windows class name or something to identify it, than you can enter x and y coordinates for size
thanks
if you see the 'place windows' settings, second tab called fixed window size .. do you have compizconfig-settings-manager ? some use simple-ccsm and i'm not sure that provides that hook ..
pattern matching.
system>administration>restricted drivers. ~/.pidgin ?
did you try the display settings in the System bar?
it only shows 800x600 nothing more than that
- is this a laptop or regular computer?
laptop, old one
- type this into a terminal : sudo xrandr -q. use a paste bin to gimme the output. no . on the -q
take out the /usr/bin/sh
just did that.  the problem is:
*
use sudo netstat -tlnp
tried that. but for some reaon the last column shows blank
Do you remember doing something before that happened?
no
you mean compression algorithm?
extra kernels in grub?
yea
apt-get remove kernel-versin-you-want-to-get-rid-of
probably you do not have the permissions to writte in the backupdisk
how do i get hte permissions? i used sudo. it worked the first couple of times i backed up
what filesystem is used on the backup disk ?
how do i check that?.  msdos
grep -i samsung /proc/mounts.  well you can not store unix permissions/ownership on a vfat filesystem
did you try a reboot?
'keep the boot partition' ? how-so?
I don't know, but when I try to create a new partition it mounts the device with the name "ubuntu...."
ah ok, 'dd' 100MB to the start of the drive after deleting the partition on it and it'll be nuked
it just overwrote files with same name
but I was in directory /vmware.  so it was like: $ sudo cp /vmware/* /windows/*.  have I lost them?
depends on what was in vmware, any file that had the same name as a file in windows would get overwritten I believe
I just had one file in that directory
so if you had a, b, c in vmware and c, d in window, your windows would then have a, b, c, d with c coming from vmware
I had one file called VMware-server-installer-e.x.p-23870.exe. in /vmware
then your /windows should be fine
there is no newer version then 2.0.8 for warty
y cant i put the hoary edition on it?
it has all the security patches backported.  dont mix distributions, either full upgrade or wait till april
maybe
I get that every time I start firefox.. I'm looking forward to a clean install of karmic
ever since i upgrade to newer ubuntu distro. i thought it's an ubuntu prob. but i guess it's because newer version of firefox sucks.
well.. I wont make up my mind until I've tried it on a fresh install
you don't mix and match versions.  9.04 packages are for 9.04 - not 8.10
all right, but I need to install that version, how I could to do?
why do you "need" that version.  that version is a development and not stable and meant for general use yet
ext4?
I don't bellieve so, I upgraded from 8.10
what video card?
indicators?.  or dock icons?
is that what they are called? the ones next to the wifi, bluetooth and sound icons.
indicators.  I'm right now working on unified keyboard indicator and I can recommend you to study code of message indicator (one used by gwibber, empathy and tbird).  it's pretty understandable
thanks! :).  I tried writing a panel applet the other day (I have one that controls my music laptop over ssh) and It just lacked a good api
i think it's all pretty uncommited type of interfaces and apis ... it may change anytime.  gnome and related projects really doesn't care about documentation a lot ....  (my point of view)
Only on archs that are not in Ubuntu I think, . But still it did
what do you want to build ?
- i installed ffmpeg from apt-get install but i built it last time so i want t build it again
why do you want to build it ? building things when you don't know what you are doing can have serious implications to your systems stability ?.  is there a problem with the package from the repo ?
install ccsm yet?
what are you trying to change about it?
you can see the file with sudo visudo
what?. hodgman you are being funny right?
sid->hoary doesn't work too well. You're better off running sid _with_ hoary or vice versa, but one of them needs to be pinned.
I checked wiki and it says only gnome is problematic. which I don't care :/
I presume you only have hoary lines now?.  it's doable if not a bit crufty
yup.  well I will report any success :-)
I run sid+experimental+hoary myself pinned to sid to make things easier
mkfs varies depending on your hardware
well i have 3500 amd 64, 2 gig ram. can i pm you  im getting a headache trying to keepp up
a 2 gb fs? sounds slow to make.  i know nothing of time though
did you use sudo or gksudo?
nope
what did you use?
edit in what way?
edit in a mode that it is changed
rephrase what you mean....
If I type : lspci -v I will see that my ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL-8169 Gigabit Ethernet (rev 10) is displayed it has kernel modules: r8169 assigned to it. I want to change it so that r8168 is assigned to it and not r8169
hardware failures can be really flakey...  blacklist the one you dont want to use. and load the other module
because I have already blacklisted r8169 and it is still showing
rmmod it...
The port isnt forwarded
I've put one in my router, but it still has the same problem.
Is it forwarded properly?
maybe not. Got some tips?
lol, other than read the manual, not really. Every router is different... Make sure you are forwarding it, and not triggering it, and make sure you are forwarding the right port to the right server.
yes, I think so
with or without compiz
depends on what card you have
??? no clue. I only found out it existed about 5 mins ago. Installed it and it is running some kind of configuration. Apparently it will fix my router config so that I can use nicotine.
but do you know what upnp is?. it usually allows unauthenticated clients on your local network to establish a port forward to itself. imo, it's not something you want :)
ok... so do you have any idea why nicotine still says my ports are closed?
use mp3burn
ive converted and burned at least 3 cd's, the same exact way. never had any problems. mp3burn doesn't like me
why ?
doesn't see my burner
its a cdrecord frontend
open up a folder, and on the left panel, right click on the folder you want to remove and click "remove"
whats the problem?
still getting the hang of linux and i cant get lm-sensors to say anything other than virtual device. and my feet are cold
okay did you install all the lm-sensors dependencies?. this would be the eye candy desklets or screenlets app i take it?
nope, maybe? how?
ok maybe you can first tell me what version of ubuntu u are runing and what app is using the lm-sensors
im running ubuntu server 11.04 and i wanted to see the temps and fan speeds
ok ur running server got ya.. okay i would go over to the Ubuntu-server channel. i am not so familiar with server as i am desktop. wouldnt want to tell you wrong thing
is there any other router or firewall between you and the internet?
Yes, I have a Buffalo Wireless router.
ok, are you using NAT on that buffalo?
cat /etc/[URL]nf
what happens when you plug it in?
its already plugged to my router
oh
its a NAS not a USB
does it ping?
what?
does it have an IP address?
you can't download it directly from Sun
logout, hit ctrl-alt-backspace, login.
login via what, a desktop or an ssh session ?
And the starting one too??
with the default setup, you need to be in "admin" for using sudo. always.
i added a user, with shutdown priviledge only, but I have not added the user to admin group, so it would not work?
how did you give them shutdown privilege?
via visudo.  like usernam ALL=(root)/sbin/shutdown -r now
that should work without the user being in admin
a [URL]p is generally built along with the kernel. have you recently built a new kernel on your machine?
yes
then you can find a [URL]p in the build directory. place it in /boot, preferably renamed to match the current kernel version.
errrm build directory?
where you put the source for the kernel you built :-)
the CD?
did you not build this kernel from source?
yes, from the liveCD. I didn't do it manually
you don't mean "installed from a package" right?.  "build from source" means "compile the source code and install" :-)
For what kind of access?
i just would like to have multiple people working on a website i have and thought it might be good to have svn (or simmilar)
Sure, but, via ssh? HTTP?
either i guess. but http is preferable
ssh is the easy one.
ok
If you have svn installed and they have ssh access, svn+ssh:// will Just Work.
so would you be able to do the ssh way from a windows client?
Yes..  I know that TortoiseSVN supports it, at the very least.
oh well i was gonna use tortoise anyway.  so what do you need to do to set it up?.  ive only ever used it from a clients perspective
First you need to create a repository..  "svnadmin help create" for more info on that..  Are you familiar with putty and pageant at all?
ribs, i am
Same problem as me?
the ubuntu version is old
it was working for ages, then suddenly did this. even deleteing .kde/share/apps/amarok didn't fix it
yes, mine occasionaly hangs on the start, usually it works it self out after a reboot or the removal of the ~/.kde/share/apps/amarok directory. lol ribs. you thought of the same thing i did
that is what is meant to happen, an upgrade to the latest distribution updates packages and installs new ones.
but all is stopped by libcups that will be terminate for any strange
oh, hmm.  no error?
in System->Administration->Networking
manual way? not running gnome.  i got this in my /etc/network/interface: iface wlan0 inet dhcp
and it doesn't do it? if you do ifdown wlan0&&ifup wlan0 ?
yes, that works. :) the problem is it doesn't do that on boot.
is it a pcmcia card?
yes
have you done anything unusual in init.d?
havn't modified it at all. hotplug devices are pulled up, wlan0 find's most suitable AP, just doesn't send dhcp request.
in the boot sequence, you get "starting card services" before "configuring network interfaces"?
generally flash will be slower than hdd
i mean for caching small things
if you're talking usb3 with old IDE drive...
what for ?
I have the ubuntu 11.04 server install can't find /media/cdrom issue
during the install it can't find /media/cdrom ?
14.04?
yes new install
And you installed gnome-shell?
not explicitly I just did a normal install
Oh, so you are not accustomed to Unity. (Is that it?)
define "won't let"
It says access denied, though when I connect over the local network it does it just fine.
are you trying to use root which you've horribly created a password for?
You want to get it going for dialup?
yes, now i am using ethernet, but the owner live in a place without adsl
Find the modem by going to a terminal and typing dmesg | grep ttyS It should show up as ttyS5 Test in terminal sudo screen /dev/ttyS5.  Your ttys x will be differsnt.  I happen to have a similar xircom here... 10-100-56k
dmesg tells me 00:0c: ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A that should be the serial port
Test in terminal sudo screen /dev/ttyS0 but I dont hink it will be.. that looks like std external serial port
i obtain a blank screen....
type atz.  followed by enter of course
i tried to type atz in screen, but i see nothing, btw i dont know screen
Then that isnt the right port Use ctrl-A then K to kill the modem terminal.  from terminal type lspci and look for the modem
I'd guess that when you unzip/install the PHP, you would to that to either the /var/www or a virtual host directory. It looks like installer should be in there
Does it matter that I installed RoundCube from my package manager? (apt-get)
I didn't know it was in there. I remember when I installed phpmyadmin from packages it went somewhere most unexpected.
I can access the login interface but when I log in it says 500 internal error and anything I click brings me back to the login screen and says session expired/invalid
you done this? [URL]  which suggest /usr/share/roundcube as the main install dir
I've found that directory, I already created the sym link.
it's possible that installation is complete as part of the config process. So maybe there is no need for a /installer directory ?
I'm going through dpkg-reconfigure roundcube-core right now. This seems to be what I was looking for.
and the roundcore-mysql is installed too?
in /usr/bin
yes firefox is slower than IE. on linux
Metacity is GNOME's window manager, IE: window decoration.
thank you for clearing that up :)
The GNOME themes are just GTKthemes.
your your pc running linux ?. i mean, your local PC
yaeh mine yes
login to the remote system with : ssh -X hostname
the other one is a mac (but "should" be similar)
-X will enable X11 forwarding, the app display will be sent to your local X server
don't do that
Don't fix that ?. why ?
spam the channel with it
because you didnt install mplayer-gui probably. mplayer is a command line prog
gigs?
gigabytes lol
:).  you can try df -h
ty
is the results you want?.  ^_^
the shields up section at [URL] might know something.
yeah it says a lot of stuff... that do not belong to actual config...
so the CPU might be going a full speed.
" lsof -i:<portnumber> -n " shows the programm using that port
no.  dont do stuff as root in your home
so user, so permissions are right
ls -al .config/hexchat/ | nc [URL] 9999
if you don't have admin privileges you can not unlock the users
<unconvertable>  It's my machine. <unconvertable>  I have root password
try pressing the greyed out unlock button
sir i apologize but technically i am new in ubuntu. how do i update through the alternate cd? i have just downloaded a live cd of gutsy but my first install was from an upgrade from feisty? thanks
Please pastebin the output of "sudo smartctl --all /dev/sdb".
foremost recovers lost files
ya that's all i need to do really. Thanks let me see if I can get that to work.
its not "complicated" to me, i use it a lot. but you have to use quite a few steps.
ubuntu-trestricted-extras installed <unconvertable> should install openjdk
depends on the hardware you got. !wifi
a Droid with USB tethering
[URL] google-fu!
Has apache got the php server extension installed?
I don't understand the question. Do you mean you have 10.10 installed on a hard drive and you want to use the 11.04 live CD as the boot loader?.  then, yes it will work
why compile - you have packages
You can't just do that, you'd have to rebuild the package from source.
setupcon -f
now my fonts got thinner. lol. how do i get a list of the fonts. man setupcon ..?
/etc/default/console-setup
either very slow (or bad) ram, or more commonly, an Nvidia gfx card with nvidia drivers version 180
yes such services are known as pastebin and such
i am looking out for uploading
in that cause any file upload would suite right?
alt-ctrl-f2 login and do 'sudo adduser' then alt-f7 to get back to gui and see if that user has same problem
yep same problem
id alt-ctrl-f2 and run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg since it seems to be an x thing not a user config. before that are you using beryl or anything?
yes im using builtin feisty.  compiz*
ah. hmm i had a similar problem that was solved by upgrading version of beryl but that might be a pain on ubuntu. umm are you using nvidia or ati. you might upgrade graphics driver that'd be first thing id try
hrm im using intel drivers..
i915 setup?
automounted ones tend to live in /media
@ try chmod +X setup.sh
most likely in /etc/eggdrop
merci
i think
Are you on a live CD?
no it is a full install of server 10.10 with Desktop GUI installed on top. but I am running this command through SSH
Well, it complains that the fs you are on is read-only. I note that you said mkdir mnt/sdd and not mkdir /mnt/sdd so is your current working dir on some read-only meadia?
Can you offer any advice?. just saw your response :-)
What does pwd say?
it just tells me my current dir
Which is?
/home/user
Any idea why that is suddenly read-only?
if I try sudo mkdir /mnt/sdd then I get the same result. nope not sure. maybe I need to be root?
Well, you *did* put sudo in front and also, the complaint was that it was read-only. Perhaps you have had some sort of fs failure that prompted the partition to be remounted read-only?
have you ever checked out rdiff-backup?
well i want to copy one hard drive onto another. and the destination hard drive is empty. i am doing rsync -ax /mnt/hdb/ /mnt/hda/
just once?
?? why would you do that?
java or javascript?
javascript
visit [URL] and compile the source you find there enabling javascript
Mirage?
i think so
ja, just tried it. except that OSS is old/outdated
well, usually, but right now, the flash installer is broken, so it requires a little more work(but its ot hard)
<unconvertable>  same question here. i guess there's a way to automount the drive but i don't know how.
GRUB uses its own nameing scheme. its hd(#,#)
try for a nvidia 7series or higher
as in 7xxx?. 7600, 7900, etc.
yes, i have an 3yr old 7600gt, and its fine on the all the distros since 8.04
that's a real-time kernel?
yes.  yes it is. rt on hardy worked with fglrx.
hmmm, i don't know much about real-time kernels. i don't know.  what version of the fglrx driver?
what would you do on a normal kernel?.  I dont know. I have tried to install whatever is in the Ibex repo.
i don't think there is an fglrx driver in the Ibex repo... unless they recently added it, because ati only recently cam out with an fgrlx driver that works with kernel 2.6.27. s/cam/came
not this then? [URL]
i would download the this file... ati-driver-installer-8-12-[URL]n, make it executable, and then run it while i'm in x-windows, then reboot... that's how i would install it.  ok. going to look at link now..  looks like an older version of the fglrx driver than the recent fglrx 8.12 release. my version is... 8.56.4
edit the master.cf file to limit outbound and inbound messages
could you explain a bit more ?
my drives are not showing on disk utility or in places bt i can see them on gparted.  its an ntfs file system
try 'sudo mount -a '.  so long as your drives aren't corrupt, you will be able to access them on ubuntu..  any progress ?
i [URL]s says can't find sdb2 in /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab
do you have more than one HDD ?
i have 2
k, how many partitions ?
only one on that hard drive
there's something called ntfs-3g. umm, you have that installed, is uppose ?
which release?
how to check.  how to check that?
lsb release -a
What does `file /bin/sh` say?
hi chai, thanks for the response. it gives the same error message. it always just says "file: could not find any valid magic files!" no matter what file I apply it on
What does `which file` say?
anaconda3/bin/file, it uses the anaconda distro. well ~/anaconda3/bin/file
You might get better help in #python or something like that..  Assuming that Anaconda is the Python distribution.
aye it is. it seems weird to me that a core linux command like file would use a version that comes with anaconda, but I suppose it has to do with the python magic libs I use. anyway, thanks for the advice, I will try
The user's home directory can contain a bin directory. If it does, the files in it are used before the system files..  If you want to prevent that, move the distribution to some subdirectory of the user's home directory instead. Then, its bin directory won't be ~/bin..
that works for me, but its not very reliable. I useually try to avoid the dash because its super slow
try 'xterm -ls' it may only change for your login shell.
that also used bash
yea.. noticing that also. :P.  not sure what the deal is. heh.. make a new profile that runs the shell ya want. I perfer the 'fish' shell myself.. chsh changes the user login shell. This determines the name of the users initial login command..  try it at the console.. it used the new shell there for me. :P
I figured it out. I'm running zsh as a custom command rather than my shell
heh.
i belive you could always give the port/options on teh command line and they will override any config file ssttings.
You can use iftop I guess.  or vnStat
you probably have a /boot on each partition and you're seeing one, then the other?
Feels like that, but I don't understand how I can examine the situation. Can I list /boot in my root partition without unmounting /boot?
what do you mean 'list'?
I'd like to know if I have another menu.lst in my root-partition before /boot is mounted
i guess you could boot to a live cd, then look at your partitions that way.  is that wahat you meant?
Sounds fair, yes. Just thought there would be another way. It's an lvm partition so it'd take a while..  I'm going to experiment some with grub, feels like it's booting from wrong partition in some way. Not good.
install sysinfo.  whats LVM?>
sr0 is the cd/dvd/optical disk. its possible you have a bad burn.
open up a text edior with root privleges.
type about:plugins into firefox's address bar and see what version you've got
9.0 r124.  how come i can view all videos except the ones on facebook?.  i can view the ones on facebook like 4 days ago. how to install flash 10 properly?
sudo apt-get --reinstall install flashplugin-installer
do i need to uninstall 9 first?
how did you install 9? outside the repos?
long time ago. and i installed version 10. but somehow couple days ago version is back. i dont know why. do i do this 1st: sudo apt-get remove flashplugin-nonfree. then close ff and this? sudo dpkg -i sudo dpkg -i [URL]b
check .mozilla/plugins folder, and remove and flash releted .so files first.
Download the package with synaptic.  Then select it from the sessions list on the logon screen
I already have FluxBox.  0.9.14
In that case, just start the package manager and hit update
Wanted to know how can I upgrade since I get this 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded..  I did that's what I got 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
Are you sure you don't have the latest version?
did you install amarok using aptitude or synaptic?
a tracker?
try ##networking
Do you have any NFS mounts in /media?
no, but I had sshfs. It seemed to stop after that
Is sshfs a remote file syste?
yes, it mounts a connection to a directory on an ssh server
Has that server been shut down? I have had a similar problem with nfs and it was due to a server being down.
[URL]/
sure, what problems are you having?
i just can't install it...something about no such file/directory
huh?
i tried using the synaptics package manager, i installed the java package there, and it didn't work. so i tried using sudo, and following java's instructions. didn't work
let's try installing it from the command line.  using apt
apt?
advanced packaging tool.  it's what synaptic uses in the background.  so, open up a terminal
ok
then type in sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre
hm..something's working. but how would i know that if i never used this forum and asked people lol. what if i tried to follow java's instructions?
beats me :P
off topic.
there's VideoRam option under the card definition, see man radeon
I have Driver "fglrx" right now, is there a reason I should use radeon instead?
no, I don't have an ati, man fglrx will have the info as well, I assume
hmm it doesn't.... it says "radeon" only supports 2D for my card...
that was only an example
man gflrx doesn't exist...
lol, I guess it's not ubuntan, is it :)
ubuntan?
VideoRam is a standard option for all cards
press Control+Alt+F7
did you compile ver 15 or 16
16
use 15.. 16 does not like our mixer
if you can remove quiet and splash from the boot options u will get some error reporting
i saw splash in there but not quiet. i remembered that when i was running that system on linux mint live usb i had to boot in compatibility if tha helps
so why u messin around with ubuntu? ;)
Yes.
eth1 is likely to be an ethernet RJ45 connection
nessieliberation, well my cable is plugged into the ethernet card.. though wht im askign is which one should i choose for the firewall to monitor!. nessieliberation , should it b the ppp0 or eth1 !
load a system monitor, and see which one moves. chances are it might be both
nessieliberation , yup its loadded allready and ur right! both of them are moving
then a guess would suggest that both would be the safest option. although just ppp0 might work
no it's just forbidden
do you get a blank screen after the error?
no, just after login i receive that error and appears the bug window "aport.." to send a notification crash.. but i continue without problems just on login
have you updated any kernel recently?
your system is not in an aceptable state.  as I told you earlier.  1.) you should not be logged in as root 2.) you should have a non-privileged user 3.) you have no need to use sudo as root
<ctrl>-<alt>-<+>
cat /proc/cpuinfo
Will that tell him what it's doing right now, or just what it could do?
That will just give the clock speed
-> is the driver for it loaded? what does it show iwconfig ?
I need to install the driver.  - you still there ?
-> yeah, go and load your driver first
: check your cable connection
what has the cable got to do with my display?
: you know, the data to the screen need to be pass throw y cable. It's not wireless from now
which videoplayer?
what sort of info ?.  enable the backports repo and try to update
how i enable the repo? what address has it?
open system --> admin --> software sources manager and just enable the backports repo in that
i'm remotelly connected to a server :).  maybe just feisty-backports ?
then edit /etc/apt/[URL]st by hand
aha.  and?
andwhat ?
what is your problem
I was messing with update-motd, and it stopped working. I cleared motd, and later rebooted the server, but the motd won't come back. no error messages that I'm aware of.
np =).  motd for ssh or local session?
ssh.  haven't tried local yet, should I?
if local is what you need... but your problem doesn't seen to complicate.  just checking onething... just a sec
there is a /dns command available in more irc clients, you can use that '/dns [URL]'
no in firefox
when replying to someone, its best to use their nick in your response, so they can see your reply
sure
what do you want to do ?
well lfs would be good b/c you can make it to do exactly that program if it is to be embedded
ahhhh, I see
so it is not embedded?
well, it will be embedded
then lfs would make it simple and easy
cool ;). how much space you think I can fit it in?
kinda drawn out but it will be *perfect* for _you_.  depends on drivers and such daemons
no daemons, remember?. no video drivers. a sound driver. no USB drivers. and no PS/2 drivers
the custom kernel is almost very small
can you explain your problem once more?
I'm trying to figure out why dhcp addresses are not going to certain switches. When i run dhclient, I'm getting the dhcpack from 127.0.1.1 (I'm not running a server), and I assume it's getting it from a local cache (already wiped /var/lib/dhcp3/).
you run dhclient and get an address? I don't understand what this has to do 'with certain' switches
Heh, sorry i'm explaining it poorly. I'm trying to figure out if a port from each switch can get an ip address from the dhcp server. But my dhcpacks are coming from 127.0.1.1, so I can't tell which one is working
switches usually don't mess with dhcp, you are not trying to give an IP-address to the switch, are you?
that looks scary... why does it want to run nmap ? (the port scanner???)
there is a good app... i just dont remember the name....
do you know which driver you are using, alsa, oss?
Alsa
under preferences->sound do you have multiple choices for each dropdown?
"HDA Nvidia (analog)" "HDA Nvidia (digital)" "Pluseaudio"
i'd try each one, and play sound, and see if it improves. for the sound playback option
Did you forward everything that comes in on port 80 to your webserver ?
- yes, i do. Through my router
Try connecting your computer directly to the internet.  If you are able to connect via LAN, it seems like a router mis-configuration
- can't. i have a combined router/modem.  - well, i did exactly as when i configured my ssh, and that worked
Okay. What do a "traceroute <host>" show ? (pastebin, please).  From outside your network
- i don't have any machines outside my network.
Ah, that's why! :).  You have to enable a special feature in your router if you are trying to access your server from within your network on a public IP / domain.  What's your domian/IP ?
- [URL]
Hm, no. That dosn't work.  What's the IP ?
- or [URL]
Maybe you misconfigured DNS
- 213.64.134.153
Okay, looks right - weird..
- you are not getting any webpage served, right?
But again, the webserver is accessible through LAN ?.  Nope, no web page is being displayed
- yes
And 213.64.134.153 is YOUR ip, right ? Not some redirector, dyndns or what ever
- Nope, that's the ip to my router.
Okay, seems that port 80 is not open
#opensuse #freenode google, [URL]
What irc server?
this
so do i
doesn't those usually have some kind of switch to just extract?
UVF happened last week
set -dpms
you could /msg alis list *searchterm* . i can't speak too much to furry remix but it appears it was discontinued some time ago
i have same problem, and i use --force-all option on dpkg -i
are you installing the 2.6.29-4 kernel?
that debian systems probasbly needs something more, like nvidia driver or something
it cant be that simple lol.  are you using kernelcheck to compile yours?
i tried 2.6.29, for somereason it didnt work so i still run 2.6.28.? something.  make oldconfig, make-kpkg ...
but you had a problem installing 2.6.29?
i have had that problem sine 2..28.3
AWESOME, the --force-all option worked.. its going thru the config..
it fails on some post-install process.  and keep old kernel there too
what "make oldconfig" is that were your problem was?
what is kernelcheck
kernelcheck is a piece of software that Master Kernel wrote to auto download and compile kernels (newbie friendly).  is it safe to get rid of everything in /usr/src even my current kernel headers?
i make my kernels that old way, and then using make-kpkg to ubuntu .deb.  make mrproper is safe to do after compile in linux source dir
what is the make and model of the laptop (I assume a laptop)
yeah laptop, it is a fujitsu, mg75k
can you please give FULLdetails in future
> at least your trying I have not attempted that ye
installer336: at least now I am doing the IRC on the server, and not through the live CD on my laptop. heh
yet
do you have a router
yes
and is it DHC. DHCP*
sudo service Network-Manager stop ... not working ?
no bootstrap in init.d, first place i looked
try sudo service NetworkManager stop
Sure thing, ill let you know how it goes.  output: 'NetworkManager: unrecognized service'
ps -A | grep NetworkManager
Have a running process, output: 2523 ? 00:00:00 NetworkManager
it's weird that you can't stop it
dont forget to install the kernel modules
I did
ok. then i have no idea.
do I need virtualbox-ose?
that's an older version of vbox
I'm using non-free. ok
-ose is the free one.  but the version of it in the repos is older
: type ifconfig -a and see if you have your ethernet cards
obviously as i am chatting here on the same computer with you
eth1 is available  ?
there's just eth0 though.  i can't remember for sure, but i think i have a faulty eth0, so there should just be eth1
that's your problem  the driver is not loaded or so to make your eth1 available
not even worth trying.  pretty sure intel GPUs are locked to the system bus too, so i doubt it's an option
can i force the boost to be enable at will. *enabled
desktop?
mobile
that's a terrible, terrible idea. no ideas if you can
damn. well thanks anyways. could I try to use and MSR intel utility to alter the gpu clock?
highly doubt it
uhm... i think i tried doing that once
A little. Not very fond of it though.
well, mine isn't working at all from months to now. why don't u use it?
When I ask it to do larger tasks it gives no indication whether it's doing anything or not. For instance, I was trying to work around a bug in Banshee by removing album cover art from MP3 files. I selected all in easytag and told it to remove them. No feedback at all, but when it was done, some had the album art removed and others didn't.
how did you install it?
right click on the file, then goto properties, then on the "open with" tab give the full path to the blender executable
you've been already told to use your linux user & pass
explain the issue in detail please
.. I am trying to play some music files .. but dont hear sound
is the audio muted? click on the sound icon in the panel
.. when i click on the sound icon - gnome-volume-control -- it just says "waiting for sound system to respond"
ok. open up a terminal window, and then type in alsamixer
.. done .. what do you want me to check there
make sure the channels arent muted. master, pcm primarily. you unmute or mute with the M button
I asked them..
Yep..  for adding aliases
aliases are in modules.d I think. let me check. modprobe.d even. yeah they are in /etc/modprobe.d
Ah, great
whatcha installing?. probably pop3
Going to try IrDA
it's limited to 11 Mbps
I realize that, but it's extremely slow as in bringing up google takes 2 or 3 minutes.
no clue. I only know about limitations of the driver, my experiences with it have convinced me not to use WLAN on Linux :P
You can always change it
the next version :(.  it's not yet supported
Could you explain what you just said? What isn't supported yet? What doesn't support what is supported?
the regular installer doesn't yet support LVM/LUKS in natty
Thank you . How can I connect to the internis.et via my wireless card? I am unable to use the alternate cd because of th
you don't need to connect to the internet during install
What is set for the autoremove setting in /etc/apt/[URL]nf.d/50unattended-upgrades ?
in X?
what must it do?.  ssh (sftp) is best
flip /dev/devicename and /media/devicename in the command
what i do was , ---> mount -t iso9660 /media/cdrom0 /***.iso
mount -t iso9660 /path/to/[URL]o /media/cdrom0.  the mount point comes after the device or image
sure.  as long as you don't hibernate the system
open a nautilus window, then hit CTRL+l to get the abbility to type your locations, then type smb://WINDOWSSHARE
did that and it just tells me "could not be found", but so quickly that I don't really think it actually tried...
did you connect to it by name, or IP? also, can other computers on the network connect to that share?
i don't have any other computer to try with, unfortunately. I tried by name, and the name is pingable. trying by IP yields the same result though.
can you check the firewall settings on the computer that you are trying to get to? make sure that windows file and print sharing are allowed.
fail2ban will log what it is finding (by default, INFO level). You can look at the logs to find out what is going on.  alternatively, you can raise the log level to gather more information
it must have been because I tried logging in too many times? I mean I thought it was supposed to return an error if I do that. is that normal for fail2ban? Like to just not even respond with anything?. if I try too many attempts that is. What's the normal behaviour supposed to be?
usually fail2ban will issue a DROP command if you over-try something it is monitoring
so DROP as in drop the socket connection to the server?
so you could, for example, look at what DROPs are currently set in iptables.  to drop the received offending packet
you shouldn't restrit the user that much from choices
`man conky` should give you the information you seek
i have just done, but i don't understand
Let me take a look at mine, hold on..  `conky -c filename` where filename is your config file.
which ubuntu?
The only way partitioning would interfere with hibernating is if your swap is smaller than your RAM.
yes, i am aware of that
Logs?
nothing in logs but it does automatically open up a problem report after the reboot.  many fields in the problem report Details. one of them is "Problem Type: KernelOops"
Might want to scan through dmesg | less or boot.log
in theory it should not but in this case it is probably because by putting it there xchat ends up starting before the notification area has been created
d'aw.. that makes sense..  probably nothing I can do, right? besides just starting xchat manually
hmm there is a hackish solution that might work, then there is patching xchat ...
lets start with the hackish solution :P
do you know about the startup.txt file for xchat?
what do you mean
I mean, get to a shell without having X running on another
/etc/init.d/gdm stop
md5sum works nicely for a terminal.. or you're looking for something with a gui?.  I think there's a similar app for crc32
uefi usb as first boot
what error(s)?
i get a RCPT access denied. the funny thing is I can receive mails for hosted domains
that's not an error message. userspace logs, kernel logs
I don't know if you figured it out, but I looked into the upstart stuff, and apparently you should set <unconvertable> start on runlevel [!0123456] <unconvertable> instead of the start on line /etc/init/[URL]nf. It will never start and not give an error, and you can still start it manually.
if restoring the Windows MBR is what you really want to do, then you can practically boot up Ubuntu 11.10 live CD or USB, either is fine.. And then this command "sudo dd if=/usr/lib/syslinux/mbr.bin of=/dev/sda" should restore it back.. Considering that the hard drive your Windows is in the first hard disk in the first place (/dev/sda)
I am actually in the Ubuntu 10 Live CD right now. And yes the first sda is the windows
then you just have to issue the command I gave you earlier.. So I take it Windows is in /dev/sda1 partition, and inside the /dev/sda disk, right?
Correct and I just issued the command. Done!. It said 0+1 records in. 0+1 records out 404 bytes copied..  I'm going to reboot now and see if it worked.
I see. That sounds about right. I think it's actually 440 bytes :P
Yep
And better than widnows 7?
Yep
So ubuntu needs less ram than windows.
Yep
Does Ubuntu use about as much ram as windows XP?
Probably something in that neighborhood.
anything at all showing up in your boot menu?
: otherwise it'll be crontab
sessions has nothing about adding a script on startup, and I don't know the command anyway :/
!crontab | . blah
"ifconfig"?
thx
worked for you?
I do have the same problem
what graficcard to you have ?. i got the intel gma
an ATI
hmmm
i have just been turning it off
looked at "groot" in /boot/grub/menu.lst yet?
probably something like libgtk-dev. do `aptitude search libgtk`
i'm doing apt-cache search libgtk and i don't see anything, do not have aptitude but i doubt that would make a difference?
Hm.  `apt-cache search libgtk | grep "\-dev"` have you tried something like that
theres a whole pile of them.. thousands i imagine
I'm looking for a special XBOX-channel, but I can't find any.

not that i have ever seen/noticed.. thats just copied over.. guess you could make their .bashrc do somthing the firsst time its ran.. what are you wanting to do exactly that needs this?
you are aware that any program running on your webserver will be able to change your iptables? is that a good idea?
It should, yes. The kernel handles that, and they use the same kernel
what? no the java is in /usr/java/jre1.5.0_06/bin/java
what point in the boot process does the screen go black? it might be usplash
after grub.  it works fine when I use recovery mode, so I guess its something to do with the splash screen being our of sync?
did you try to turn off "quiet"? then you can see it as it boots and look for an error. Another option is to look at /var/log/dmesg. I would do both.  that is a possibility - i have a problem with my usplash and haven't got around to fixing it a second time yet

sounds like broken hardware prob the headphones
they work fine in windows and my fiance's mac.  I actually had the same issue with a previous pair of headphones
so you claim that its software while all you do is move the headphone plug around ?.  maybe your hardware is not supported ?
i suppose that's a possibility, but I can't help but think its a software issue as I use these headphones on windows fully plugged in without any issue....
yeah so thats weird

what locale are you using.  for spellcheck to work, make sure you have the hunspell packages for your locale installed
how to check it ? I think it's English(India) under Tool > Language > For Selection in Libreoffice
It doesnt seem like there are any hunspell packages for en-in
It's still not working after installing hunspell packages
If you change the document language to en-Us ?
After changing to en-US it's still not working.
hmmm
I get that error too when typing "modprobe snd_seq_oss", that is normal
how can i get it working?
looks like you are using an old tutorial. What are exactly trying to do?
install tuxguitar
installing it or using it?
install then use.  if i start it i get /dev/sequencer: No such file or directory
I get the same error, its irrelevant. Could it be, that tuxguitar is working properly but you just don't get sound?
well, the whole point of tuxguitar is to get sound, otherwise it's useless, every once in a while instalation succeds and i get working sound but i don't know why it wont work now.  i'm pretty sure it has something to do with the missing modules
I dont think so, that issue is usual and also happens to me on every new computer. Start tuxguitar, go in the tuxguitar settings and tell me your settings under "Sound"
tuxguitar sequencer (should have real sequencer in there), midi through port (should have java sequencer in there)
"should have"? you are confusing me
do "sudo apt-get update" first amd make sure the unvierse and multiunivers repos are enabled.
put it in <code> tags?
I believe xbindkeys
so there's no system wide way to do it?
well on gnome you can go to system/preferences/keyboard.  then Layouts tab and then click "Options" button on the bottom
thats what I'm using (gnome) but I can't find the setting
look under preferences/keyboard...layouts tab Options button
got a similar problem with my internal data drives, working on the fix now...........just need to know what a few options are before I try it on a spare drive
I'm going to try to reformat as fat16 and see if it works any better.
FAT 16 sucks in ubuntu
32bit procosseor or 64bit?
Yea im not sure, i know ive had issues with this laptop before.
how old is the lap top? and it's probably 32bit.  also people that have a 64bit prossor that get the 64bit Ubuntu tend to then get problems with Flash and stuff
Its pretty old, its a Compaw NX9010
ok well I am pretty sure it's 32bit
Looking up the specs it does state the processor as:
if it's pretty old it is very likely to be 32bit yes
Intel Mobile Pentium 4 3.06 GHz.  But even then im not really sure what to make of that :)\

yes put the 1386 version of Ubuntu on it :).  you can try it from a Live CD if you haven't already
Yea i should do that. Thanks for your time. ill hit up the 86x and let you know how it went once installed
you can also try.  Ubuntu inside WIndows
yes

and can you launch the live session?
same error with live session
ok, and has is worked before, or is this the first try?. it*
same error with my laptop, had to install using usb, but i dont have the usb drive any more.
if the cd gives errors on both systems, i'd say it's due to the cd
i remember when i was installing it on my laptop, someone in here said something about my bios isnt set right or that the installer doesnt read sata drives that well.
there you have it, but i cannot give advice on that. ah, 'someone' said, it's not a bios error you're getting?
not a bios but looks like a mounting error
on two different pc's?
sure
anything I should know before hand? as in possible limitations or hangups?

sometimes it this process starts and eat the process but other times there is n't clear process doing that , so I wanna disable that one to narrow the discovery
how did you get the previous malware/bad application ?
long story please I don't wanna talk about it,sorry
fine good luck sorting out your issues.
can you clarify that?
in current directory i have sub directory called x ,wget 'someurl' o/p of wget should be stored in x directory
try using the -P parameter and specify a directory like: wget -P x www.c.com/read.html
no i don't want wget to save the files in directory(host) from which it was run
so you want wget to send whatever it downloads to a directory on another networked machine?
sudo /etc/init.d/samba start. !breezy
will that start all the daemons?
that should start smbd and nmbd.  you can take a look inside; (try 'less /etc/init.d/samba') -- i think it starts nmbd first
it said failed. lol
then perhaps your config file is broken
lol
you did remember the 'sudo', right?
i was in root terminal
try 'restart' instead of start.  you can use 'testparm' to check your samba config file
i did. it said ok. and restart passed
ah, so it was running already
yes but not working.  my windows machine still wont recognize this comp.  do a lot of people have problems with this?
samba can be tricky to setup.  can you ping the windows machine (using IP addresses)? and vice versa?
put it in /etc/fstab to mount it at boot time. if you want it to automount when you connect it you will need to create a udev rule I think...
Thanks  I will look up the udev rule, duh! dont know why the fstab didnt strike me
I haven't done it myself but should be in /etc/udev/rules.d
Cool!!, thanks again.  have a question. what happens if the drive is not connected when the server boots and fstab entry is present
then you can mount it normally.
but would tbe boot fail?. i mean would the server still boot up?
"mount" will follow the rules as set up in /etc/fstab. no the boot will be fine as long as the external disk does not mount to a system critical point such as /lib for example.
does it work with a proper vnc client app?
Umm one sec let me check.  Yes it does my friend
then java or your browser are to blame.  what OS / browser / java are you running on the client system?
Ubuntu 8.10 / Firefox / Java5
64bit or 32bit?
64bit. I think it is anyways, how would I check
id look at putting 32bit on it so that you can run Sun's Java. It can help..  64bit java isnt really implemented properly yet
are you trying to get more resolutions available to you?
-> is HDMI even supported yet in linux?
video, yes. audio im not sure. my HDMI video is perfect. I've tried everyhting to setup audio with nvidia but no luck. so im hoping HH fixes that
-> more of my curiousity, how did you enable that?
if you put the cd in your computer and reboot, starhawk1, and it boots into ubuntu then it works.  and double check your BIOS is booting from the cdrom
thats just it it isnt working
so are you running linux or windows right now starhawk1?
you do not neeed to reboot with linux. Sometimes you mat need to restart the application.  what printer are you trying to get working?
not a gs extension no, but if you want to go that route, why not install an omnilauncher like synapse or albert etc. straight-away?
well I got gnome-do now - albert I haven't tried. Does it have an equivilant in OS X? Because I feel like I remember that name...
you might be mixing that with alfred, i don't know OS X to tell whether they're related :).  synapse is in the repo's, for albert you'll need a PPA --> [URL]
ooo - I always like to try out new things :D THat's why I'm running Ubuntu 17.04 now. I'm kind of impressed that Ubuntu is probably the only distro that currently supports flatpaks, snaps and appimages... I've tried elementary, solus, fedora, opensuse, endless os.... or 17.10, I mean... artful
i personally like albert a lot, very configurable via plugins, impressive feature set .. yes you're right, for experimenters Ubuntu has taken on new life
I'm kind of excited... I'd like to advocate Linux to common users, but one big barrier to entry is the complexity of actually obtaining software....  if snaps, flatpaks and appimages run stable, across the board, you could choose any distro you'd want, and get your third party apps directly from the vendors website :D. At least that's what I'm hoping....  craaaaap... mono -.-
you need stereo?
no, I mean alfred - it downloaded a crapton of mono dependencies.  cus like a genius I downloaded Alfred and not Albert xD. g'doy
ah wait, i hate mono myself, you might get away with the --no-recommends switch when installing, let me check.  lol
this os x app had a similar name, like a typical name of a buttler. So I thought "alfred"....  ...which would be a better name... I'm Batman~!.  o - qt5 :P
only some qt dependencies yes
yeah, but that's fine. qt5 is actually quite slim and nimble, if utilized correctly.  kind of disappointed that I couldn't run commands with arguments... though that maybe a plugin, I guess
i just noticed i get 'albert' from [URL] PPA, has a newer version
I've got 0.11 now - I see on github it's at 0.12. with a plugin called "terminal"
correct, the webupd8 PPA has that
: have you installded guest additions ?
try 'cat imagelist.txt |.  cat imagelist.txt. d'oh :-).  'cat imagelist.txt | ./iPhonePNG' - sorry - I'm apparently losing my ability to type :-)
chrissharp: It just reports back, "Usage: ./iPhonePNG <input>" Which means that no filename was passed to it.. chrissharp: You think I need to use xargs in there somehow... or?
'for i in `cat imagelist.txt`; do ./iPhonePNG $i; done'.  try that
no
can you tell me what would be involved?
backup and full re-install
ok, thanks..  do all the dirs under my home folder get deleted? I read somewhere that they do not.
you have a separate home partition?
fuser -m /mnt/iso will tell you what's using it.
/mnt/iso: 5946c. what does that mean?
process 5946 is what's using it.
maybe change the uid for the mount
hmm, who does those two things connect?.  if i "touch somefile" than "somefile" as Owner in "file properties" have " - Samba guest account"
a file that's in a samba share, or not?
where ever i create file under this user
in ~/ ?
has same Qwner. yes
and you're sure you're not logged in as a Guest or something like that?
well, i'm, since this username that i use is "older" than samba nstallation
eh?. read [URL] maybe
burn to CD if you can. You'l have to create partitions fro ubuntu though.
i had some problems with mbr when installing on other partition, but what is the difference between wubi and doing it manually?. (wubi does the same just automatically as i have understood)
wubi installs ubuntu in your windows installation. This means it uses ntfs as its file system. ext4 is better for ubuntu
Oh, i didnt know that
about mbr, if you are going to dual boot then install ubuntu's grub in mbr. it will automatically detect and add a windows boot line
Then i will try again. I will just shrink my disk and make a primary ext4 parition and shrink a swap primary partition, and just install on them? (and grub will automatically detect my win 7) , right?
it should
do i have to choose "side by side" when i run the ubuntu installer? or just choose advanced partitioning and chose the partition?. and when i do chose side by side, to i have to shrink and make the partitions before i run the installer?
advanced partitioning
i see. and both swap and the primary ext4 should both be "primary" ?
ul have to resize your windows partition if there is no space to install ubuntu.
i know, i use shrink to do that, i rezise so i get two partitions, one swap and one for the ubuntu os
not necessarily. they can be logical
what is best, logical or primary?
how many primary partitions do you have?
did you mean unfs3?
For the channel's info, is this a wired connection or WIFI you are attempting to activate ?
Wired
No GUI on this server, correct ? Then show us what you have for the control file in a pastebin ' cat /etc/network/interfaces | pastebinit ' . See if we can spot an error there .
That would run fine if I was connected to the internet :). I'll just type it up real quick
Yeah, not having a connection do make relaying info a bit more challenging . But, no step for a stepper .
does it work as of now, and your having to type the password to bet it connected?. get
right click on the volume applet on the panel and you can bring up a full volume mixer
^^
for example for adding wine repo:. sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa
that you are dualbooting should not have anything to do with a ppa.
rm -rf /jaunty-mount-point-here ?
how can I get the terminal to output the mount points
try "mount"
How did you upgrade?
Only one application can have control of the sound resources at a time under Pulse -- an unfortunate bug. You can switch everything over to ALSA an try it that way if you wish.
better use the options within Eclipse.
are there known problems? well I tryed it from the software center and it didn't work like on my other distribution
I wouldnt know, I only develop Java in Eclipse, no other languages. If you set up the repositories in Eclipse correctly, it should be able to download the Eclipse specific parts.
allright. thank you
np :-)
may I ask another question? ^^
sure. If it has to do something with ubuntu, after all this is the ubuntu support channel.
it's more about eclipse
ok, but I think you will get more help on #eclipse. I am not a professional programmer. Just a student.
but kind of ubuntu too. anyways ... i installed open-jdk7 yesterday and alot of jdk6 packages came with it? is that normal? also after installing jdk7 und starting eclipse it tells me that I can't use jdk7 and I have to use jdk6
Can anyone help me to get ibus to function *properly* so that I can use the US-Int., w. deadkeys and enter text in Japanese using anthy?.  yes thats normal.
if your keyring password is the same as your login password, then using your password to login should avoid the prompt for the keyring password
whats the output of: uname -r
3.8.0-35-generic
so using the modules from kernel 3.6 would be a downgrade not an upgrade
/var/log/<things> kernel mostly. One good idea is to use a remote server, this way both the disk and network need to be inaccessible for you to loose your log msgs. In dire situations serial ports(non-USB) are handy.
cheake: When the system locks up everything goes down, network included, and any files being accessed at the time in a few program become 0-lengthed
hmm, I'd be suspicious about the claim that files are truncated... Though in-proper application locking can cause that effect.
sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
read the manpage, use -R for recursive chmod
edit menu.lst and put in the entry for Ubuntu?
i replaced the /boot partition of the ubuntu with /boot of fedora
that sounds a bit bad
i dont have any backup too
why not just use Ubuntu's Grub?
as described in the manual
I cant find the file to install it in the Synaptic Package Manager...
then you asked the question wrong, you mean how to find openvc?
do you run a local X server on win10 (like xming
best way would be to make a .desktop launcher file for the script that way you get a proper icon.
is the file in a directory that is not in your home?
I have a test file in my home directory that it's failing on
try right-click on it and check the box for making it executable
you're probably reading the wrong guide
[URL] is the guide im reading
use /etc/init.d/samba instead
to get it to work for me, I had to delete the vertrefresh and horizrefresh lines from the xorg config.
right click open with.  right click > properties > open with
yea but how can i make it open with itself. its an standard application
go where i said and try deleting wine from that list
ok
i won't say wine is satan, but it has certainly caused more trouble than native apps, lol
the open source drivers are no where near as well suited to the task of 3d especially with nvidia
I'm currently running the proprietary nvidia drivers, should I be running the Nouvaou drivers instead?
it may be you are running in framebuffer mode which dosen't support 3d rendering.. try running lsmod|grep fb and see if you get a result..

Ah , yes , hello . I'm calling to get some info about your PIN services . You see , my friend also has an account with you and also enjoys shopping on the Internet . She recommended I sign up for this service too .
That was a wise decision , if I may say so . Our Personal Internet Banking Service offers online shopping transactions , payment of household bills online , account management ...
I will probably just use it for online shopping . At the moment , I have to meet the seller in person and pay cash , if it's a local seller .
Yes , I have .
That's good ! Just make sure to bathe them later .
No problem . I can do that for you .
Thank you ! You know they have to go to the vet on Saturday ?
I know . What time do they go ?
Their appointment is at eleven o'clock in the morning .
My boss sent me here to take some business documents back to his office . I didn't know you were working here.What a surprise.How long have you been doing this ?
Two years or so .
That is great.Do you have to work the night shift ?
No , in most cases I don't have to unless there is something urgent to deal with . I work five days a week .
Do you enjoy work here ?
It is hard to say.But I've to start by working as a trainee before I really become an experienced marketing assistant.Sometimes , I am really under great pressure when it gets busy .
Take it easy . I'm sure you will gain enough experience while working as a marketing assistant . I hope you haven't been given much trouble in the job .
Luckily not.The silent I meet are generally very friendly and have a good boss .
Nice to meet you .
May I know your name , please ?
I ’ m Rose Teller . I think I ’ Ve seen you somewhere before ?
Ah , yes . I remember now . Were you Mr . John ’ s dinner partner last month ?
Yes , I was . You work for 3M , right ?
I did but now I ’ m for Microsoft . How are things with you ?
Good .
May I know what you do ?
I ’ m a fashion designer . Next month , I have a fashion show . I ’ d love it if come . I can get you a couple of tickets . So you can bring a friend if you like .
Sure . That would be great . Good luck .
We better see if he ’ s o . k .
Sir ... sir ? Are you all right ? Sir ?
He ’ s not answering . You ’ d better check his pulse and breathing .
Oh , no . He ’ s not breathing , and there ’ s no pulse . Call 911 .
What's the matter ?
I've got a dozen things to do and they all have to be done immediately .
Not too good , I'm sorry .
I lost ?
It was close.To be honest , you had the lowest price by three cents per hint , but they didn't like your delivery date.Acme promised them almost a full month sooner .
So the price was good ?
Yes , they loved the price , the delivery date was the problem . They just didn't want to cut the delivery date that close.If something went wrong and you didn't deliver , we might not be able to get stock in time for Christmas.If you could have been two or three weeks faster on delivery , they might have gone with you .
So I didn't miss by much then .
No.It was very close and they argued over the bid for a long time . Better luck next time .
I knew the delivery was slow but I figured the price would win it for me .
Oh , thank you . Yes , please . What I need is to handle some domestic affairs .
Oh , I see . In what area ?
Well , I need a Deposit Certification to handle this .
Yes , we have this service . Have you got a deposit certificate and your passport ? I'm sorry to ask you , but your passport is very important .
Yes , yes . Here it is . By the way , is there a handling fee ?
OK . This way , please .
How much is it all together ?
Let me see . 100 dollars .
Can I pay by credit card ?
Sorry . You can only pay in cash .
OK . Here you are .
Thank you . Do you need the invoice ?
Yes . And can you pack the things up , please ?
I use it almost every day , but I usually only use it to check my email . I don ’ t often surf the net . You use the internet a lot , don ’ t you ?
Yes . I use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company . It can be frustrating when the connection is poor .
So , you ’ re online eight hours a day .
Yes , I like the job though . Sometimes , I help other people in the office if they ’ re having trouble online .
How useful do you think the internet is as a source of information ?
I think it ’ s fairly useful , but there are two big problems . First , a lot of the information you find online is false . Second , when you buy something online , you don ’ t see it until you actually get it .
How do you solve the website problems when you ’ re buying something online ?
Yes , of course . I'm Jimmy White .
Nice to see you again .
For the bank manager ?
That ’ s the one .
What happened ?
You were right , it was from a headhunter . He wouldn't tell me anything without a signed contract .
Well , no surprise there .
No ! Not at all . But I did find out they have more than one position with different clients , so at least one would probably work out .
Great , so are you going to sign a contract with them ?
I ’ m going there tomorrow .
Great ! Good luck .
And I think I'll look in on a few other Employment Agencies while I ’ m downtown , to see what they have .
Me too . No one has expected he can really get somewhere with his business .
What can I help you with ?
I'm not sure how to find my next class .
Do you know what building that it's in ?
The C building , I think .
Well , that's not far away .
Could you point me in that direction ?
Do you know what the room number is ?
It's C261 .
My next class is around there .
Can you show it to me ?
Absolutely . Here it is .
Could I try it on ?
Please do , the fitting-room is over there .
It feels a little tight around the waist . Do you have a bigger one ?
I'm sorry . We don't have this color in your size . We have some green ones in your size . Would you please have a look at this green one ?
OK . How much does it cost ?
Yeah . Why not ?
Because ... I heard John got married yesterday .
Oh , you went to the wedding ?
No , he didn't tell me about it . Don't feel bad .
Thank you for your compliment . But you are exaggerating . I think you are destined to be a singer . You have the best voice !
Thank you . Maybe we can sing a song together . Would you like to sing with me ?
Yes , I'd like to . It's my honor . Let's pick a song .
How about this one ?
Sorry , I can't sing the song .
Er ... How about this one ?
OK . But I'm not familiar . I don't know the beginning part .
Never mind . You can follow me . I'll sing the first part .
I haven't made up my mind . Maybe I will go to the US . What about you ?
I am going on a hiking trip . It's good exercise as well as fun .
I think so .
So why not come and join us ? Lee will come as well .
Good evening . Could you let us have a double room ?
How long will you be staying ?
A week or ten days . We'd like to have a quiet room , if possible-not too near the street .
Let me see . Yes , you can have Room 313 . It's at the back .
What's the price per day ' ? And are the meals included or extra ?
20 pounds per day , including breakfast .
All right , we'll take it .
Very good , sir . Will you register , please ?
OK .
I try and look at the programmes that are on to decide which particular ones interest me , rather than you turning it on a seven o'clock and you leaving it on until half-past eleven when the programmes finish .
Do you think of television though as a great time-waster ?
Un ... I think it can be a time-waster and it depends on how particular people are about what they want to see ... Mm , it can just be a sort total amusement for someone and totally consuming without reallyconsidering what it is they're watching .
Aha , but how do you prevent it coming into your life and taking oversour evenings and at the same time perhaps get . . . get out of thetelevision some of the sort of best things ... best programmes that ... that undoubtedly are on television ?
Well , I suppose one of the problems is ... will depend on what a person's life style is , and that if he has other outside interests which are equally important to him as television , he will then , you know , hmm . be more careful about which programme she wants to watch because he has time which he wants to use for other things .
Do you think though that ... that in . . . in a sense television skilled people's own er ... sort of , creativity or their ability entertain themselves because if they're bored all they do is justturn on the television ?
I want to see you play . Be quick !
Of course . Reservations aren't necessary , but we recommend them as our restaurant can get quite busy .
I need a table for two for tonight .
What time ?
We'd like to be seated at 8p m .
Smoking or non ?
Non-smoking .
What name is the reservation under ?
My name is Paul .
Really ? Generally they will turn out to be a good thing .
That ’ s right .
I usually have cereal for breakfast .
But isn't it served with cold milk ?
Yeah . Cold milk wakes me up .
Chinese people don't like to eat cold food .
Is that right ?
But I'm open to new things . I'll have a bowl of cereal , too .
With cold milk ?
True . I always see him drinking instant .
Let's take him some of Kitty's best and make the pitch again .
Do you think that will be enough to make him have a change of heart ?
No , what happened ?
They had an argument and split up .
We'd like to have western food today . Could you tell us something about it ?
Sure . The first food you have is appetizer , followed by a soup . Then you will have the main course . The last dishes are desserts .
Yes , we're ready to start the invitation to tender . You're well informed . We'd like to build new factory .
When do you open the tender ? And where ?
We intend to open the tender at first next month in Beijing .
And when is the closing date ?
The time period is set on June 29th .
Could you please tell me something more about the conditions for the tender ?
All right . The area of the factory buildings is around 8,000 square meters . You can read the details in the invitations which will be sent tomorrow .
Thank you for your information .
You're welcome .
I'm sorry to have taken up too much of your time .
It doesn't matter . We'll be in touch .
Okay , bye !
I didn't know you liked old movies .
I love them , especially the all-time greats like Gone With the Wind .
You're so right ! Today's movies are just too commercial !
I still have no idea what to do now .
Don't act like this . Please have good thoughts in your mind . What's behind you ?
I could not agree with you more . But I feel worried about what to do next as soon as I begin to write my resume .
There is no need to do like this . We can surf the net and find some templates for resume .
Sounds good . I will do it in a jiffy . OK ! Let's put our heads together .
You said it . We can also find some helpful advice from some experts .
Yes . I booked a single room in your hotel for this Friday . But I ’ m sorry to say that I have to cancel it . My wife is very sick now . I don ’ t think she ’ ll be able to travel by this Friday .
Oh , I ’ m sorry to hear that .
Thank you . Can I cancel my reservation ?
Certainly . May I have your name , please ?
My name is Tom Smith .
Okay . I have canceled your reservation , Mr . Smith .
Thank you very much .
Yeah , I don ’ t have to pay for a space on the street .
Really ? How long did it take you to find a spot yesterday ?
Well , last night it took me half an hour to find a spot when I came home from work .
You get home late , don ’ t you ?
Yeah , around seven . Most of the street parking is gone by then .
Ah , well . You can ’ t have everything .
I can ’ t think of where to go .
Where would you like to go to school ?
I really don ’ t know .
You can ’ t think of anything ?
I really like where I ’ m at now .
So , why don ’ t you just stay here ?
That may be what I ’ m going to do .
It ’ s a perfectly good school .
You ’ re absolutely right .
Do you know what you ’ re going to do now ?
It's not cheesy ! It's romantic . When it first came out , I saw it in the theaters five times in one week .
Really ? Well the special effects might have been good in 1997 , but when you watch it today they make the film seem really cheesy .
Alright , maybe it's a little bit cheesy . But come on , isn't it fun to go to a cheap flick once in a while ?
Actually , I have to admit that you're right . I like some pretty cheesy movies too . I love Arnold Schwarzenegger action flicks , especially " Terminator . "
Haha , that's definitely a cheesy movie too . Did you watch it over and over again ?
I am Mr . Foster , and we have a 7:00 dinner reservation tonight for four people .
Welcome , Mr . Foster , if you would have a seat in the lounge area , our hostess will be ready to seat you in just a moment .
We are going to have a drink while we are waiting . Please let the hostess know that she can find us there .
She will come and let you know when your table is prepared .
Those patio tables are new , aren't they ? Would it be possible to be seated out there ?
An outside table is available right now if you would like to be seated immediately .
We would love to sit outside . Thanks for your help !
Here is your table , and now may I take your drink order while you are considering what to have for dinner ?
Yes , could you please bring us a pitcher of margaritas and four glasses while we are figuring out our dinner order ?
I'll put your drink order in and be right back to get your dinner order .
Open your mouth , please . Which one ?
The one right at the back .
I'm afraid we can ’ t save that one . It will have to come out .
Will it hurt much ?
I'll give you an injection , then you won't feel pain .
Some what ?
Some Chinese food . I ’ m hungry , and there ’ s a take-out restaurant near here . We can have them deliver and then watch the news on TV while we eat .
No , I ’ d rather go out . The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home . Maybe we can try some other food today ... What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day , the one over in the shopping center ?
Okay . I could go for that . It ’ s called Al ’ s Steakhouse . They also have great fried fish , and I love their salad bar . You can go back to refill 1 your plate as often as you like .
Is that the place that serves such large portions of meat ?
Yes , their steaks are enormous . Sometimes I can ’ t finish what I ’ Ve ordered .
What if that happens to me ? I hate to let food go to waste .
Sure .
Here is the ticket .
I just had a quarrel with him .
Would you rather I taught him a lesson for you ?
I took a lot of courses , such as Philosophy , Logic , Ethics , Aesthetics , etc .
Which course did you like best ?
That depends . What does she look like ?
Well , she's got a beautiful face and long curly red hair .
How tall is she ?
She's fairly tall , maybe 2 inches taller than me .
Is she chubby ?
Not at all . She's actually very athletic .
It sounds like she's pretty good-looking . Does she wear glasses ?
No , but she does wear contact lenses .
How's her skin ?
She's got a gorgeous complexion with a few freckles on her nose .
Does she have any piercings or tattoos ?
I think she has her ears pierced and she definitely has a few tattoos
What's the tattoo on her foot like ?
It's a butterfly - everyone in her family has one .
Even her mom ?
Yes , even her mom .
What's her personality like ?
She's a lot like me .
How could we ever manage to buy a big house when we are always living beyond our means ?
I love this store . The only problem is that it ’ s extremely expensive .
don ’ t worry . I ’ Ve decided that for your birthday I ’ m going to take you shopping for a new dress .
really ? I thought you hated shopping ?
I do , that ’ s why you should appreciate this gift !
sure . That ’ s really nice of you . Let ’ s go in and try some things on .
how about this red dress ? I think it would really suit you .
that ’ s gorgeous ! Do they have it in a size 8 ?
here you go.On any other day , it would cost me a fortune , but it ’ s on special offer today .
I think this color isn ’ t quite right for me . Do they have the same dress in white ?
let me look . Let ’ s see ... they ’ Ve got one in blue , green , pink , black ... and white . Here you are .
this is perfect ! What do you think ?
I think you look fantastic . Happy Birthday !
Yes . Can I deposit valuables here ?
Of course , you can . Please put your articles in this bag and seal it .
OK .
Thank you . Here is your tag .
Would you tell me the rate per day for depositing my bag ?
Sure , madam . Only one dollar .
When does the cloakroom close ?
This cloakroom is open until 10 p . m .
Oh , dear ! I won't be back until about 11:30 tonight . Where can I pick up my bag ?
We will transfer your bag to the Lobby Floor Cloakroom . You may collect it there , madam .
I see . Thanks a lot .
I want to take out some money , but there's a massive queue for the ATM so I thought I'd do it over the counter .
Unfortunately , an ATM is being refilled because it ran out of money . That's what's causing the hold up .
Oh , I see . I thought maybe it was just the time of the day , although it isn't usually busy at 2:30 in the afternoon .
You are right , you've just missed the lunchtime rush . Could you fill out a withdrawal slip , please ?
I did that already , while I was waiting . Also , here's my card .
Thank you . And you require ...
800 RIB , please .
Please enter your personal code right here , on the key pad . And sign here , please .
OK ...
Thank you . Here's your card back and your money . Please double check it for me .
I'm going to Beijing tomorrow . I'm packing my luggage .
What will you bring along when traveling ?
I will take some clothes to change and cleaning items .
Have you packed the camera yet ?
Yes . I've already put it in my suitcase .
Pack some necessary medicine in your carry-on .
Yeah , I went to school today . Were you there ?
No , I didn't go , I've been sick .
That sucks . Did you want the assignments from English class ?
That would be nice , thank you .
No problem , you're welcome .
I will be glad to do the same for you when you're sick .
Oh , hi , Leo . Sure , what ’ s up ?
Well , I ’ Ve been meaning to talk to you about the situation in the office .
I ’ m not in there very often . It ’ s so noisy that I can ’ t work .
That ’ s exactly what I ’ m getting at . We ’ re supposed to be able to do our preparation and marking in that office , but have you noticed ? Jack constantly has students coming in to get help with his course . A lot people are going in and out .
Has anybody spoken to him about it ?
No , not yet , but someone ’ s going to have to .
We can ’ t really ask him to stop having students come in for help , can we ?
No , of course not . But I ’ m not able to do my work and neither are you .
How about recommending him to use the storage room down the hall ?
Oh , that would be too small .
With the cabinets taken out , it might be bigger than it looks .
Come to think of it , you may be on to something . Let ’ s go have a look .
There's an Ethernet cable in your room . Just plug it into the back of your laptop .
Uh-oh ! I can't use Ethernet . My computer is wireless only .
That's okay . I can tell you about some alternatives we have .
Any alternative that works will be great .
Well , there's our computer lab on the first floor .
That sounds good . What's the charge ?
The lab and the computers are no charge , but you have to pay for whatever you print .
That sounds good . Now , how about the other alternatives ?
Of course . Our lobby is set up for wireless , so just bring your computer down here .
Use my laptop in the lobby ? That's great ! Now , if I need to print something there ?
So what ?
You want to watch , don ’ t you ?
Not really . I couldn ’ t careless about the Olympic Games .
Are you saying we don ’ t have time to watch our favorite show tonight ? Jane , you know I really don ’ t like our teacher all that much . He gives far too much homework . He criticizes me in front of everyone all the time .
To tell the truth , I don ’ t really like him either . He ’ s kind of boring and not very active . He always looks unhappy too .
Yes , and he also ...
Do you think we should be talking about him like this behind his back ?
Probably not . After all he is our teacher . We should try to find something nice to say . If you can ’ t say something nice you shouldn ’ t say anything at all .
I absolutely agree . It ’ s getting dark . We should finish our homework now .
Is it formal or informal ?
I guess it ’ s formal .
Then , you should dress well .
That ’ s right .
I think a white shirt with a blue tie looks nice on you .
You are smart .
Of course , the sports shoes don ’ t go with the formal occasions .
You are right . What kind of shoes should I wear ?
The brown leather shoes go well with your trousers .
Good idea . Oh , by the way , would you please pick me up after the party , honey ?
It ’ ll be too late ; you ’ d better take a taxi .
I'm making three thousand yuan a month at my present work . I should not , of course , make a change for less . Could you provide me with a monthly salary of four thousand yuan ?
I don ’ t think we can give you that much as the starting salary .
You know , Mr . Allen , Nowadays this starting salary is not high based on my skills and experience .
Maybe , but there are many fringe benefits here .
What are they ?
Additional to medical benefits , we also offer a rent free house and the use of a car .
But I have my own car and my own house .
OK , 4000 yuan a month .
Thank you very much .
Of course Mike . Who else ? We fell in love at first sight .
When's the wedding going to be ?
We haven't decided yet . There are a lot of things to sort out , you know .
Are you having a big wedding ?
Yes , I've always dream of having a big wedding .
But what do you say about that ?
I don't really enjoy big occasions , but I think I ’ ll come round to the idea in the end , It only happens once in a lifetime .
What ?
I said , Bonjour !
What ’ s wrong with you , Ted ?
I ’ m speaking French . Don ’ t you know anything ?
What ’ s wrong with speaking English ?
Well , I just got back from my language school . We have to speak French all day there . No English allowed !
What are you doing that for ?
I ’ m trying to learn new skills . It makes me more qualified for a good job .
The most important thing to do is to make sure you know the company and what services or products it provides . Do you know all about them ?
Yes , I pretty much understand the company .
Well , after you've done your research , you have to decide whether the company is casual or formal . Have you decided what they are yet ?
Yes , I've been observing them .
When you are choosing what to wear , keep all of that in mind . Have you chosen what to wear ?
I already have something to wear .
I would always be ready to go shopping with you ! Should we talk about other basics ?
OK , I am ready to think of other things .
Do you want to sent this letter by ordinary or registered mail ?
By ordinary airmail please .
Anything valuable in it ?
A post order for four hundred dollars .
In that case , you ’ d better have it registered .
Will I be informed that my friend gets the letter ?
Yes . When your friend gets it , he ’ ll sent the receipt which you send it by mail . then you can be sure he ’ s received .
We are always willing to choose the big ports as the loading ports .
What's your unloading port , please ?
No , I can't agree with you . She's one but not the other .
What makes you think so ?
I said , " Is there anything I can do ? "
If it's not too much trouble , I would like some help .
Yes ? How can I help you ?
Are these drinks on sale this weekend ?
Yes .
Can I buy more than one case ?
Yes . The limit is four per family .
Okay , I ’ ll take four , please . You saved me a lot .
I know . This is a really good bargain .
Thanks .
OK . What sort of agent , exactly ?
The agent we are looking for will help us in Britain with publicity , advertising and so on .
Yes , can we help you ?
We have a problem with our roof . Can you come and have a look ?
What sort of problem ?
We have water coming through . It was raining yesterday and this morning we noticed a wet patch on our ceiling .
Is the wet patch just in one place ?
Yes , it seems to be just in the living room , above the window .
Did you look in the attic ?
No , sorry , we didn't .
Is there easy access to the attic ? We'd better look since there may be some flooding there as well .
Yes , we have a hatch with a ladder .
OK , we can come early this afternoon . Is anyone going to be at home ?
Yes , my wife will be there .
Right , we have an urgent job this morning but we should finish around lunch time . We will then come straight over to your house .
You mean this month ?
Oh , yes , how's it ?
OK , no problem . Have you found the blank ones ?
Yes , I have seen them .
Yes , well put your name on it after you have downloaded it off the company website . OK ?
Yes , I understand what to do .
You fill in the hours and total them for the week . Have you ever used a 24 hour clock ?
What ? Huh ?
So after you noted the hours , starting at zero which is midnight , you just write down the minutes as a dot followed by minutes . Get it ?
Huh ? What ?
Just make sure you show your total , sign it , and turn it in .
I thought you said this was easy .
I ’ Ve been having trouble breathing lately .
Have you had any type of cold lately ?
No , I haven ’ t had a cold . I just have a heavy feeling in my chest when I try to breathe .
Do you have any allergies that you know of ?
No , I don ’ t have any allergies that I know of .
Does this happen all the time or mostly when you are active ?
It happens a lot when I work out .
I am going to send you to a pulmonary specialist who can run tests on you for asthma .
I prefer a package tour , and we don't have to worry about accommodation , meals or that sort of trivial demanding things .
Ok . I understand that we basically work form 8: 30 to 5:30 with an hour-long lunch break from 12 to 1 , right ?
That ’ s right , although we do expect you to do a little overtime if there ’ s something important to do . The lunch break is flexible . You can go a little earlier or a little later if you prefer .
That ’ s fine . Is it OK to have a coffee break during the working day ?
Of course . The main thing is that all our work must be completed on schedule . We even allow our employee to go home early if they finish their work early .
How often do you have meetings ?
You should attend a department meeting every Monday morning . There are other meetings for people working together on certain projects.Department heads also attend an interdepartmental meeting each wee
I ’ Ve met some of my colleagues already . I ’ m sure we ’ ll get on well together .
You are entitled to a company car . Have you seen it yet ?
I was told to take a look at it this afternoon and take care of all the paperwork .
Ok . This is your cubicle . At first , you ’ ll be responsible to me . Later , you ’ ll be working more independently .
That ’ s fine . I need to learn how you do things here first . Salaries are paid directly in to our bank account , aren ’ t they ?
OK , go ahead--what is the excuse THIS time ?
Actually , I did it , but then it got lost .
Could you have gotten it done at another time ?
Yes , I could .
You have never missed an assignment before--when will you be making this one up ?
I'll make it up early next week .
That would work , but don't let it happen again .
I'll try .
Yes , I'll have tomato soup and my friend will have mushroom soup .
Do you want anything to go with soup ?
Much better . My heart sank when Mary told me that she wanted to leave me .
Don ’ t be sad . Everything will be fine .
$ 40 .
Do you receive cash only ?
We receive credit card as well .
License and registration please . Have you been drinking tonight , sir ?
I had one or two glasses of eggnog , but nothing else .
Step out of the vehicle , please . Sir , what do you have in the back ?
Just a few Christmas gifts , ’ tis the season , after all !
Don ’ t take that tone with me . Do you have an invoice for these items ?
Umm ... no ... I make these in my workshop in the North Pole !
You are under arrest , sir . You have the right to remain silent . You better not pout , you better not cry . Anything you say can and will be used against you . You have the right to an attorney . if you cannot afford one , the state will appoint one for you.do you understand the arrest to you ?
Why don't you have any more money ?
I wanted some chips at lunch today , so I spent it .
That was a bright idea .
I know.Do you have some change I can borrow ?
You know what ? I don't have any change for you .
I need to get home .
Why don't you just ask the bus driver for a transfer ?
I don't have money for a transfer .
You know ? Go ask for a transfer . They're free .
Really ? oh ! I'm glad you let me know .
That sounds like a good idea .
Would 7:00 be OK ?
It depends .
Do you like coffee ?
Um . It ’ s delicious .
And do you like English food ?
I came here to ask for some information .
Ok . Please go ahead .
I bought a pair of trousers last year , which I like the best . But this year they don ’ t fit me very well . They ’ re tight in the waist , baggy at the knees . Can you make some alterations ?
Oh , we are skillful in doing that . You can trust us . Our shop has a history of more than 20 years .
It seems I find the right place .
Yes , absolutely ! We have a very good reputation in the neighborhood .
When can I have my trousers if I bring it to you tomorrow ?
If you like you can wait here . They will be ready in one hour and a half .
I would like to return an item .
What are you returning ?
I want to return this cellphone .
Is there a problem ?
It's broken .
What exactly is wrong with it ?
The phone turns off by itself .
That's fine , but do you have your receipt with you ?
Yes , here it is .
I'll refund your money right now .
George , how can we ? Vacations cost money . And this month we don ’ t have much money left after paying the rent .
Well , Lili , we can visit different places in the state in our van . We are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . Trust me , it won ’ t cost much .
Where will we sleep , then ?
In the van .
What about other expenses ?
Let ’ s see . Gas , food , recreation , we won ’ t spend much . Come on . Don ’ t hesitate . We need to get out of the house once in a while . We have been working hard , haven ’ t we ?
Maybe you ’ re right . When do you plan to go ?
The sooner the better ! I can ’ t wait !
Oh , I don ’ t know where we ’ re going yet .
As long as we ’ re going , you can decide where to go . I trust your judgments . I know you miss Chinese food , so we can eat at a Chinese restaurant this time .
Certainly , but will it take long ?
No , I'll be right back .
Good morning , Ms . Walker . What can I do for you ?
We need to deliver some documents to our Monroe street branch . Can you come by and pick them up ?
Do you also believe in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy ?
What do you mean ?
I mean that you're gullible . You shouldn't believe everything you read , especially on the Internet .
But it seems like a good idea . All I have to do is first send some money to the person who sent me the letter . After that he'll tell me how to earn much more money .
Sounds like a pyramid scheme . Have you heard of those before ?
Pyramid scheme ? What is that ?
It's a scam 7 that's based on a hierarchy , like a pyramid . The person at the top asks the people below him for money , and then tells them to go and ask other people for money while sending some of it back to him .
Sounds good to me . The guy at the top gets money and so do the people below him .
Not exactly . The scam keeps on going , with the people at the bottom paying more and more money until they reach the very bottom .
What happens then ?
Nothing . The people at the bottom give their money to the people above them , and they get nothing . They end up losing . That's why it's a scam .
Yes . I should have gone to buy the ticket in advance . But now ...
But now you can stay with friends and enjoy a holiday too .
Nothing much . I ’ m going to the cinema on Friday night but that ’ s all I have planned .
So you ’ re free on Saturday night ?
That ’ s right .
Would you like to have dinner with me ?
Oh , that would be lovely . Shall we say seven o ’ clock ?
Yes , I worked as a doctor at Beijing People's Hospital .
How long have you been there ?
A little over 3 years .
In what section did you work in the hospital ?
What do you want to go to US for ?
I have been invited to teach Chinese at the University of Hawaii for two years .
Can I have a look at your letter of acceptance ?
Of course . Here you are .
OK . Let me send a memo around .
Schedule it for this afternoon , when Ken gets back .
I don ’ t think he ’ s back today .
Oh , that ’ s right . Go ahead anyways . I ’ ll fill him in . We can ’ t lose this order under any circumstances !
I need to find out some more information for L / C . I would like an outline of responsibilities , both ours , yours and the beneficiary , please .
OK , to start , the conditions are specified by the buyer and may include Insurance Forms , Way Bills , Bills of Lading , Customs forms , various certificates .
OK , got it . Is there anything else I need to know before we go ahead ?
Just that in effect , a basic Letter of Credit is a financial contract between the bank , the bank's customer , and the beneficiary , and this contract involves the transfer of goods or services against funds .
I'm happy with that price .
Let's shake on it .
I'd be glad to answer any questions you may have .
Your products are very good , but the price you ask is much too high .
If you consider our high research costs and excellent quality , the price we are asking is only reasonable .
Sure ! That would be great ! Are you good at writing or would you rather do the computer work ?
I would like to help with the computer work .
Great ! We are going to be working in teams of three . Are you OK working with others ?
Yes , I like working like that .
We will begin next Monday . Would you be available then ?
Yes , I can be there .
Well , if you could send me your basic background information before next Monday , it would be useful .
OK , I will send the information to you .
Hi , Bill , this is my new car .
Hey , great set of wheels .
You like it , huh ?
Who wouldn't ? Wow , that's out of this world .
It is special , isn't it ?
Yeah , too cool . How much did they sold you for ?
Lots . Looks like I'll have to moonlight for the next two years .
I can imagine .
Hey , let's go for a spin . You can try it out .
I'd love to .
Sure .
Can you open this bottle for me ? The cork seems to be stuck .
No , you must stay ! I swear it , and the oath shall be kept .
I tell you I must go !
Where ?
I have spoken my mind , and can go anywhere now .
I ask you to pass through life at my side-to be my second self and best earthly companion .
Oh yeah , that sounds pretty cool , I guess ...
Yeah , I'm really into video games . In fact , all my friends are on the Internet . I've never met any of them in the real world .
Thank you for your invitation . I'm free tonight .
Which kind of food do you like to eat , Chinese food , western food or seafood ?
I prefer seafood .
OK . I will pick you up at your hotel at 5:30 p . m .
That's fine . I'll be waiting for you .
See you later .
Yes . They were open this morning when I came to work . They must've finished remodeling . Why do you want to know ?
Well , I thought that maybe we could go there for lunch today . That is , if you haven't promised to go with someone else .
That'd be wonderful , Peter . But I hope you're in a better mood than you were this morning .
I'm sorry I was such a grouch . It must've been the weather . When it rains I get depressed .
Dan is on top of that . I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying !
Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded .
Everything in that minibar has been consumed , sir ?
Everything's gone .
Is there anything special you'd like ?
Just bring me three bottles each of Jim Beam and Perrier .
Okay , sir . Three of each . Would you like anything else ?
The fruit basket was great . I need a few more apples , please .
Perrier , Jim Beam , and apples . Is that it for now ?
Yes , one last thing
I think we can have a try .
Artistic tapestry is the highest form of expression of the rug weaving art , an exquisite handicraft of superb artistry in typical Chinese style .
I see . Is this the marvelous landscape in Guiling ?
I think it is .
Which do you prefer , the linen one , the figured dacron or the brocade ?
Your name and room number , please ?
Tom Wilson in Room 306 .
Have you used any hotel services this morning ?
No .
OK . You have stayed for four nights at 90 US dollars each , and here are the meals that you had at the hotel . That makes a total of 660 US dollars .
Can I pay by credit card ?
Fill out this form with whatever you need . What do you need the most ?
I need many things .
I can get a few of them right away , but might have to order some .
I can wait a few days for these items .
Make sure that you have money allocated for these supplies . How much do you have for office supplies ?
I don't think we have very much money for supplies , but we have a little .
Would you like them delivered to you or can you come get them here ?
I am not sure yet .
When you finish completing the request form , we will order and let you know when the supplies are here . Have a great day !
Thank you very much .
I am very impressed by your resume . Therefore , I am very interested to know why you ’ re willing to leave your current company .
I am looking for a more challenging position . I can ’ t grow anymore in my current job .
Ok , I understand . But why you choose us to work for ?
I have studied carefully the information about your company on the internet and I have checked your company ’ s homepage . I am impressed by the company . And I like the products a lot . Since you ’ re growing steadily , I would be very eager to help you to improve your accounting system .
How do you work with a team ?
I work quite well with a team . I ’ m a good team player . I respect people , cooperate well with member ’ s team . And I will do my best to help team members .
What ’ s your long term goal ?
One second , please . ( a few seconds later , the receiver comes back and says ) Hello ?
Yes .
I ’ m sorry . David is out to lunch right now .
Okay . I ’ m his wife . Could you tell him to call me back when he returns ?
Sure . Does he know where to call you ?
Oh , thanks . Please tell him to call my cell-phone number .
Ok , I will .
Thank you very much .
Of course . Please sit down . How can I help you ?
I bought a house recently and would like to insure it and its content .
I see . Here ’ s a pamphlet about our home insurance policy . We ’ Ve named our policy ” umbrella ” . May I ask how much you paid for your home and where you live ? These are the two main thing that decide how much your premiums are .
I understand . I live in the Oakfield area and paid $ 100,000 for my home .
Let me just check that on my computer . Oakfield is a low risk area , so your premiums will probably be around $ 100 a month . The other thing to take into account is deductibles .
In this pamphlet it says that the minimum amount for deductibles is $ 2000 . what does that mean exactly ?
It means That the first $ 2000 of any claim you make must be paid by you . The insurance policy covers any amount above that , up to the agreed limit .
Oh , I see . That ’ s fine . What is the advantage of having higher deductibles ?
If you have higher deductibles , your premium are lower , because you will pay more of the claim and we will pay less .
It seems that I should do some calculations before deciding . I presume that the insurance period can be for as long as we agree .
We initially sign one-year policies with our policyholders . These are renewable after the first year .
If I have a claim , how long does it take to make a settlement ? I ’ Ve heard that with some insurance companies , it can take months .
Don't believe him.He ' s a liar .
Thanks , Denise . Actually , I was really surprised . I mean , there were a lot of qualified people out there .
Sure . But the work you did was really exceptional ! You definitely deserved it !
Yeah well it ’ s about time ! He ’ s been living with his parents for 40 years !
Don ’ t be mean . Look here come the bridesmaids ! Their dresses look beautiful !
Who are those kids walking down the aisle ?
That ’ s the flower girl and the ring bearer . I ’ m pretty sure they ’ re the groom ’ s niece and nephew.Oh , they look so cute !
I just hope the priest makes it quick . I ’ m starving . I hope the food ’ s good at the reception .
That ’ s all you ever think about , food ! Oh , I think the bride ’ s coming now ! She looks gorgeous.Wait , what ’ s she doing ? Where ’ s she going ?
The usual time . Half past two in the afternoon .
What place ?
The usual place . In front of the treasure house .
And what should I wear ?
Your usual shirt and shoes .
What are you going to wear ?
Nothing unusual , I ’ m afraid .
Sheila , how about that fashionable blue dress ?
Really ? I was quite good at the hurdles and the discus .
I wish that I were good at the discus , but I could rarely throw it in the right direction ! I was awful . With the hurdles , I could never jump over them !
I thought you were good at the high jump !
No , I was good at the long jump . I liked the sprints best .
Did you ever win any competitions ?
I was regional champion for the 100 and 200 meters . I usually did well in the dong jump competitions , but I couldn ’ t compete with kids from other schools in the javelin . How about you ?
I came second and third a few times in the regional championships , but I never won . Did you ever take part in the national championship for the sprinting events ?
I'm so sorry , Taylor . Go talk to her . I'm sure she'd be happy to see you .
She probably wouldn't even recognize me . She's probably married .
Yi-jun said Femi was talking about you . So get out there , Tiger !
Was she really ? So you're telling me there's a chance ?
Do you want to live here ?
I'd like to , but I'm afraid I can't afford the life here .
What ’ s the matter with them ?
Look at the heels . They are slanting .
Ah , I can do it perfectly .
How much does it cost ?
6 yuan . And I can make them as new as before .
I think it ’ s too expensive . I can just give you 4 yuan . Or I ’ ll go to another B .
All right . I ’ ll repair them for you .
How long will it take ? Could you repair them while I wait ?
Yes . They will be ready in a few minutes .
Good morning ! I am Anna Lu . I've come for an interview which was arranged .
Oh , I see . I am Jack White , Personnel Manager . Take a seat , please .
Glad to meet you , Mr . White .
Miss Lu , have you got any experience in restaurant service ?
Yes . Since I entered college , I have been working at a fast food restaurant as a part-time waitress .
For how long ?
3 years .
Our restaurant receives a lot of foreign customers . Can you serve them in English ?
That's why I applied for this job . Now I am studying Hotel English in my college , and I am quite familiar with the western courtesy and restaurant etiquette . I am sure my public relation skills will leave a strong impression on your customers .
You must know our working hours are very long and overtime work is frequent .
I don't mind that .
I think I will give you a 3 months ’ trial . The salary for this period is 800 yuan a month with no bonus . After that period if we both feel satisfied , a formal contract would be signed .
When am I supposed to start working ?
Next monday . Bring your resume and diploma with you .
Yes , I will . Thank you , Mr . White . Goodbye !
Nothing .
Doesn't look like it to me .
Just get out of my face !
Woo , easy .
Leave me alone !
What are you so ticked off about ?
I don't want to talk about it .
Maybe I could help .
I blew the finally exam .
You've got be joking .
No , I'm not .
I would like to make my plea .
What is it ?
I would like to plead not guilty .
You do realize that all the evidence points to you ?
I know . But I did not do it .
How do you figure that ?
I didn ’ t commit the crime .
Do you know who did ?
If I tell you who did , will you release me ?
I ’ m sure we can work out some kind of deal .
Yes , I'd like to withdraw some money .
Fill in the slip , stating the exact amount you wish to withdraw , please .
OK . Here's my bank book , is that all right ?
OK , do you want large notes or small ones ?
In 50 Yuan or 100 Yuan would be fine .
Here's the cash for you .
I do sympathize with you , I assure you .
Thank you , sir .
My familiarity to computer is great , and I use computer frequently in my daily life and work .
What kind of software can you use skillfully ?
He was 20 years old then .
How old is he now ?
I'm quite active and energetic . I approach things enthusiastically and I don't like to leave things half-done .
Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
I'm quite outgoing i think . I enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
I maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . A person can't live all by himself I think . A friend in need is a friend in deed.The more really close friends I have , the better .
What kind of people do you like to work with ?
Yes , what are your hours ?
We open at lo
I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ’ s better to get to know it . What about you ?
I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays .
Oh , my God ! John , I didn ’ t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory .
Come on , Han Maimed , don ’ t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion .
But I ’ m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ?
Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world .
I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ’ t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ?
That ’ s a little complicated . You ’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ’ s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion .
Really ?
Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England .
Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ?
Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans .
How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ?
That ’ s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries .
So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ?
Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College .
Why did they want to found a college ?
Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well .
Oh , I see .
Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name .
When did it begin to be called Harvard University ?
In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman .
It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion .
Therefore , it ’ s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard .
Wow , I didn ’ t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history .
Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S .
I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard .
Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related .
That ’ s right . I have a lot to learn from you .
Yes , I do . I ’ ll walk you there .
Thanks !
Are you applying to study or work abroad ?
I want to study abroad .
What do you want to study ?
I hope to study English literature .
Have you got your visa yet ?
Not yet . I have an interview with the visa official today .
I see . Is it your first interview ?
No , I've already been to here for three interviews .
What happened ?
I was denied a visa ?
Why ?
Like most students . I want to work in America after graduation .
I'm planing to go balling tonight . Tomorrow I was hoping to see a movie . What about you ?
I want to go camping , you know , just get a way for the weekend . I'm not sure I'll be able to , though .
Why not ?
I have already known that . I didn't get the scholarship , right ?
Yes . The board was favorably impressed with your application , but the competition was very fierce .
Can you help me ? You know I do need the scholarship .
I'm afraid I can't I advise you to try again next year .
Thank you , Rick . We ’ Ve got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams , Brazil and China , face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round . Without a doubt , both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match .
The ref signals the start of the game and here we go . Ribero serves and China quickly receives the ball . Chen bumps it to the setter , and ... a very nice set by Chen !
Xu spikes it ! Wow , what a great hit ! The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but he managed to get the ball in !
It ’ s China ’ s service now . What a superb jump serve by Li , oh , and we have a let serve . The ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net .
Yes . Could you tell me how to send some money to someone with an account with a bank in Germany ?
Well , you can pay by mail , telegraphic or SWIFT transfer . Or you can have a banker's draft and mail it yourself to the beneficiary .
Which is the best way ?
It depends on the amount and how fast you want that person to receive the money . A SWIFT transfer is the fastest method but a banker's draft is usually the cheapest . How much do you wanna send ?
$ 800 .
Why don't you send it by mail payment order ?
How long does it take ?
About a week .
I don't know . Can I send it more quickly ?
Sure . You can have a Telegraphic or a SWIFT transfer .
And how long do those take ?
Both a Telegraphic Transfer and a SWIFT transfer will normally be credited to the payee's account within three or four working days , depending on whether the beneficiary's bank is among our correspondent banks or we have to route the transfer through a third bank .
I see . How can I pay by Telegraphic Transfer ?
Hi ! Let me get a dozen croissants , four blueberry muffins and a loaf of sourdough bread .
Sure . Would you like to have the loaf sliced ?
No , that's OK . Do you have any whole wheat bread ?
We are out at the moment . May I suggest some rye bread ?
Sure that sounds good . Do you have any cakes ?
We have various birthday cakes and also ice cream cakes .
I'll just take a cheesecake .
Will that be all ?
Yes .
I went to Yale University .
Did you ? And what did you study ?
I have a B . A . in Economics .
Would you mind telling me how old you are ?
I'm twenty-seven .
And could you tell me what other jobs you have had ?
Yes , I have worked in a bank for the last five years .
And what was your salary at the bank ?
Yes , the autumn is marvelous here .
Tomorrow will be fine too , I think .
Yes , there're some samples in our office and you can take some to study it . Besides , you see , in recent years , we've visited a diversity of factory buildings all over the world and we hope that our building is the perfect match of advanced technology and attractiveness .
That's a good idea . We can improve our technology to meet your special need .
And please let white color dominate .
OK ! I've noted it down . And any others ?
Oh ! I've almost forgot the location was transferred to the A county in the east of the city .
I'll tell them .
Well , the most important thing is that our company demand the quality be exactly the same as the sample which you'll take from the office on the third floor .
Please feel assured that we'll abide by our promise . And we'll do everything we can to ensure delivery .
Thanks a lot . And I believe I'll have a good time working with you .
I think so . Bye !
I need to make some copies .
The copier is right over there .
Does it cost to use it ?
We do charge to use the machine .
How much does it cost ?
We charge ten cents a copy .
How many copies am I allowed to make ?
There is no limit to how many copies you can make .
Would you mind showing me how to use it ?
Please read the instructions on the copier .
It's on the arm rest .
Oh , I see . By the way , what shall I do if changes in altitude create pressure on the ears ?
We haven't had any problems so far . They offer a 24 - hour technical back-up service . We've called them in three times this month . They always arrive within a couple of hours .
That's good service . Do we have to pay extra for that ?
Yes . I have been a data entry operator for three years .
What kind of software can you use ?
I have working knowledge of Windows and Dos . Actually , I'm quite familiar with both Java and C + + Programming Languages .
Do you have any other computer qualifications ?
Yes , I have an ACRE certificate , Bank 2 .
Do you know how to use a PC to process the management information ?
But I think it's fantastic and charming . Well , you have your opinion and I have mine .
Maybe you're right . But I just still can't understand ...
You mean as in Sylvester Stallone ?
nine twenty pm , I couldn't say . I cann't remember .
Are you sure you cann't remember ?
I've absolutely certain .
Were you in or out ? Can you remember that ?
I'm not quite positive . I think I went out at about half pass nine .
Did you see anyone come into the block flats ?
No , I didn't .
Sure ?
Sorry , Mr . Smith agenda is full today .
How about tomorrow afternoon ?
Me too .
We should do this more often .
How much is it for each square meter ? How large is the apartment ?
It's 7500 yuan per square meter , and I really like the one with three bedrooms and a large living room . Its total area is about 80 square meters .
That surely will cost you a lot of money . Are you going to make a full payment ?
Do you think I am rich enough to make it ? I am thinking about buying the apartment by installments . The real estate agency says if I pay a 25 % down payment , I can move in at once .
Hello , Mary , where do you work ?
I work for an Internet company .
I am . Are you ?
Yes , and for the first time .
Is that right ?
I don ’ t know how to vote .
Voting isn ’ t difficult .
I ’ m not sure what laws are being voted on .
They tell you everything on the ballot .
They do ?
You ’ ll be okay .
Thanks for telling me .
It is tough to accept it , I mean . But can you tell me why ?
It is hard to tell . Maybe it is because you're not resourceful enough to be a manager .
Wow , fantastic . I like the font and color for his name . It is creative yet personal .
Yes , it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
Yes , she does . She is good at backstroke and free style .
Then you can help her with the breaststroke and sidestroke .
But she wants to learn the butterfly stroke
Really ? Then just ask her to follow me .
I heard you are now practicing underwater swimming , aren't you ?
Yes . But I still have some difficulties it breathing .
Say , kid , keep on practicing , you're sure to be a first-class swimmer .
To tell you the truth , I have never thought of being a swimmer . I swim just for fun .
Do you have a sales slip ?
Here it is .
Sorry , things on sale are not allowed to be refunded or exchanged .
Oh , but this pair of shoes are a bit too tight . Could I change them for something bigger ?
White , please
Look ! there's a Folk concert tomorrow evening . Do you Want to go ?
I don't like Folk music very much .
What kind of music do you like ?
I like classical music . Do you ?
Not very much . Classical music sends me to sleep
I don't believe you .
It ’ s true .
You are funny !
What a surprise ! Thanks.It ' s beautiful .
Thank you for your love and care over the years , I appreciate it , mom .
This is the best card I ever received .
Mom , what can I do for you today ?
Nothing , son . I'm already very happy .
How about dinner tonight ? My treat .
Actually . I prefer we eat at home.We ' ll have more time to catch up that way .
I'm sorry I haven't dropped in that much these past few years.Business kept me too busy , I apologize .
Oh , don't mention it . I'm proud of you !
I think , maybe , it takes a real Kung fu master to give a more fair assessment ; meanwhile , I am no more than a beginner . But I really doubt whether kung fu would be of any great help when it comes to defending oneself in real life .
You mean , kung fu may not be so powerful as it is imagined ? To some extent your idea holds water . Kung fu was originally intended for self-defense , but with time it became something more than defense skills . Now we are apt to treat it as an art .
An art ! You have a good point there . So it is called martial arts in English . The Chinese are really capable of doing things nicely . They even made fighting a great enjoyment , so marvelous and fascinating .
Thanks for your compliment ! Perhaps the Chinese culture as a whole has a special inclination towards aesthetics . Do you know Jin Yong ?
I know he is a martial arts fiction writer . But I've read none of his novels .
All of his works have been translated into English . I recommend you to read one or two works of his . You'll get a general glimpse into Chinese kung fu culture . When you go through the pages , you are likely to feel they are not about kung fu alone , but cover all walks of life .
I see . They must have incorporated a series of Chinese cultural elements .
Yes , take philosophy , for instance . What makes a true , respectable da via , or a warrior hero ? It's not enough only to be formidable . It also involves a man's character , sense of justice , and values of life .
So kung fu is also a means of self-cultivation , isn't it ?
Network is omnipresent nowadays . It's quite convenient for people . You see , we can download music and information from the Internet ; I can study from it , too . And the most of all , we can compose , send , and receive e-mails .
Yeah , you are right . Internet makes our lives easier . But it's a two-blade sword .
What do you mean ?
I mean Internet brings benefit a lot , but also some disadvantages . For example , many youngsters are addicted to the games and they neglect their study ; or some bad guys steal people's money online , etc .
I agree . But I think although it has some negative effects , on the whole Internet does more good to us than harm .
What were you thinking ?
I think I want to try a new style .
What would you like me to do ?
I want you to cut my hair shorter .
How short ?
I want my hair to be only a few inches long .
Do you really want it that short ?
Yes , I've been wanting it short for a while now .
If you really want me to , then I'll do it .
I'm absolutely sure that this is what I want .
Ideal posture is to sit straight , but not stiff , against the back of the chair .
Yes .
I'm a newspaper columnist . I write comments for a living . I enjoy working in a coffeehouse .
I see . But isn't it a bit too noisy ?
I don't mind . By contrast , I quite like the circumstances , as I can see a variety of people here , who can always give me tremendous inspiration . And the most important thing is coffee as it is my life .
I can see that . Then what is your favorite coffee ?
Irish coffee is my favorite . But I can drink any other . I'm not particular on it .
All right . Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ?
Not very often . Making coffee is a bit troublesome . Most of the time , I just buy takeout at Starbucks . And also , I quite like instant coffee .
I think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular . Though its taste is not perfect , it's really cheap and convenient .
Exactly . Nescafe is the world's favorite coffee . People love it all over the world ?
Which country makes the best coffee in the world ?
Many people think Brazil makes the best coffee . Brazil exports a lot of coffee . But I love Irish coffee . So it's hard to say . Just depends on your taste .
I agree . I heard in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . Is that true ?
Yes . No doubt about that . For us , coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee .
No , we don't , especially the old people . But more and more young people fall for coffee .
When is the last time you talked to you parents ?
I talked to them probably about two weeks ago . Yeah , everything is going well .
Are you going to see them soon ?
I am going to go home after the holidays and we're going to have a Christmas kind of in January or February . Yeah , depending on when my brother can come in .
OK . And who are you more like , your mother or your father ?
Yes .
What's your name ?
Jenny Madison .
What ’ s your nationality ?
Nigerian .
What is your date of birth ?
15th of April , 1969 .
And your occupation ?
I am a painter .
What's your passport No . ?
7834623464 3367 .
Where do you live in China ?
In the Golden Mountain Hotel in Beijing .
You are suspected of smuggling . Do you understand your rights ?
Yes .
Well , you can take the No . 36 bus from here , but then you have to walk about 30 minutes .
That doesn't sound too bad .
Actually , if you go to the bus stop in the next block , you can take bus 301 which will let you right off in front of the zoo .
Maybe that's what I'll do . Thanks a lot .
It leaves at 8
I see . Are there any seat available ?
Just a moment please . Yes . You can have a seat .
Good . How much is it when we take it ?
It thirty-eight dollars .
All right . Here ‘ s forty dollars .
Here ’ s your ticket and change .
Thank you . Which gate should I go to for the bus ?
Go to gate No . 2 please .
Thank you very much .
This one ?
No , the one next to it .
The mirror is behind you , sir .
Is this a furry hat ?
No , sir . It's a genuine bonnet .
Are you sure ?
It's my pleasure , what can I do for you ?
I'm from England and I'm trying to make a travel plan for today .
What brings you here ?
I'm a flight attendant and I'm here on vacation .
Where are you staying ?
I live in the Holiday Inn Lido Hotel .
Oh , it's not very far . And as far as I know it is a fancy place .
Yes , it is . Do you know where I can get a town map ?
We sell them , right here .
Hope it all goes well . We're very busy at the moment and certainly don't want any problems at this time of year .
I'm having a little trouble with this form .
What seems to be the problem ?
There are two types of L / C here and I'm not sure which one I want .
That's right , there's ' revocable ' and ' irrevocable ' . We usually go for the irrevocable one , it's the most popular .
So , I should choose that one ?
I would recommend it , yes . Then you just need to complete that form .
I see . It's very nice of you to help me . Is this form alright ?
Okay . But what is a tailgate party ?
Someone brings a truck to the game and we have a barbecue right there in the parking lot out of the back of the truck !
How fun ! Can I bring something ?
Don't worry about it ! Just come at five .
I make a mean potato salad !
Well , if you insist , you are welcome to bring a potato salad !
Yes . Is there anything I can do for you ?
Could you tell me something about the terms and interest rates for personal automobile consumer loan ?
The deadline is normally no more than 5 years with the interest adopted according to the corresponding lending rates announced by the PBC .
I plan to take the loan for 3 years .
Well , the yearly interest rate is 5.49 % for 3 years . I'm sure you are qualified to apply for this loan .
What about the loan repayment ?
You may choose a repayment pattern by consulting with our bank , for example , payment of equal amount of principal or of principal and interest on monthly installments .
Does that mean I should deposit sufficient money to my account prior to the monthly payment date so that you can directly deduct the repayment of the principal and interest ?
Exactly . You are permitted to effect and early payment in part or in full with the consent of our bank .
That's very thoughtful of you . Thank you so much .
Yes , Madam . The reporting desk for the British Airway's flight to London is over there .
Thank you so much . Is this the desk for BA flight 123 to London ?
Yes , this is the right desk . Have you any luggage ?
The suitcase , that ’ s all . Except my handbag . Of course .
Would you please put you suitcase on the scales ? You needn ’ t weigh your handbag .
Is there a receipt ?
Yes . I ’ ll attach your baggage receipt to your ticket .
What must I do next ?
I'm glad I could help .
Here's the check . I included a little extra for you .
You didn't have to do that !
Cool ! Each contact comes in its own saline solution ?
Yep . They're prescription contacts with UV protection .
Wow ! How high-class ... a new pair for each day ...
You just pop'em in in the morning , take them out at night , and then throw them away . No cleaning !
Cool . So are you near-sighted or far-sighted ?
Do you have the ' The man and the Sea ' by Ernest Hemingway ?
Yes , we have one copy left .
Yes , of course . Here it is .
Thank you . Are all these yours ?
No , some of them are my friend's . Do you want her passport , too ?
Yes , please . Do you have any carry-on items ?
Do you want me to put it on the belt , too ?
Yes , please . Would you please open this big suitcase ?
OK . Just a moment . It's just some clothes and toiletries .
OK . Do you have anything to declare ?
I think there is nothing .
Any fresh food , live plants , or animals ?
Oh , no . None of that .
Thank you . You may lock up your suitcase . Here are your passports .
Sure , but I have to tell you that I've become a vegetarian . I don't eat any kind of meat .
When did you decide to become a vegetarian ?
I saw a program a few months ago about how animals are raised for human consumption . I haven't been able to eat a single piece of meat since .
That's great . Do you find that you eat a lot more fruit and vegetables now ?
Definitely . I've also been buying organic fruit and vegetables , which is more expensive , but much better for you because they don't have any pesticides on them .
You've really turned into a health nut , haven't you ?
I guess you could say that . Eating fruit and vegetables helps keep you healthy . I've lost 5 pounds and I feel great !
How do you get enough protein in your diet ?
Well , I eat a lot more tofu , beans , nuts and some fish .
Well , don't worry about dinner . I'll only make vegetarian dishes for you . Do you like sushi ?
I prefer cooked fish to raw fish , but if you really like it , make it .
How about a spicy tofu and vegetable stir-fry ?
That sounds great . What time should I come over ?
Dinner will be ready at about 7:30 pm , so you can come over at 7 p . m .
Where are you going ?
I have a big date tonight .
You have got a car , haven ’ t you ?
Dude , what are you talking about ? Only girls do that .
Not at all , guys also get facials , manicures and pedicures . There is nothing wrong with looking after your skin and looking good .
True . So what do they do to you at your beauty spa ?
Well , first they exfoliate my face , getting rid of all the dead skin . Then I get a face mask with nutrients that keep my skin healthy and young . Afterwards , they apply some moisturizer and you leave feeling like a million bucks .
That doesn't really sound like something I would be interested in . In any case , I just wash my face every night and use sunscreen during the day .
Well you should come with me one day , I'm sure you'll love it .
An outlet carries cheap cashmere sweaters .
That's a good idea !
I've always had good luck at outlets .
Thank you for the suggestion .
I am looking for a pair of shoes .
Do you like high heels or flat shoes ?
My house was robbed last night and the thieves stole all my furniture .
No wonder you look so upset . Have you called the police ?
No , I haven ’ t . This is the first time I have been to China .
Have you travelled to many other countries ?
To be honest , I have never been to an Asian country before but I have visited many countries in Europe .
What about America ? Have you ever been to the United States ?
Of course not . My school record was above average in my class .
Very good . What was your favorite subject in middle school ?
English . I've liked English ever since middle school , and then in university , I had some excellent teachers .
How were your scores in university ?
Yeah . They take the advantage of other people's hospitality and generosity .
I was fooled once . A lady told me she needed some money to keep the pot boiling . So I gave her some money and bailed her out of the situation . But later I learned that she had lied to me .
You are still wet behind the ears . You should have seen through her .
I like music that has a fast beat and is lively , like dance music . You know , I go to a disco almost every week . Sometimes it ’ s too loud though . You prefer classical music , don ’ t you ?
yes , I do . I find it very relaxing . I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work .
I must admit that I like several pieces of classical music . It ’ s certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music .
classical music is supposed to be good for you brain . Research suggest that it makes your brain more active . Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better .
really ? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often . I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress .
yes . That ’ s why I listen to it in the evenings . I usually play it as background music while I ’ m cooking or doing other housework .
I ’ Ve got a few classical music CD ’ s . I should follow your lead and increase my brain power .
you can find plenty of recording on the internet too . You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them .
that ’ s a good idea . You should do the same with some music . You might find something you like . Classical music might make you clever , but dance might make you livelier and happier .
hi , Andy , how are you finding your new job ?
pretty good . My colleagues seem alright . So far everything is great .
that's nice . What do they have you doing over there ?
well , I work in the marketing department . The corporate culture is totally different from my last employer . Before , when I was assigned a task , I was totally on my own but here most of the work is don
that ' s really good . It's very important to feel like you are part of the team at work .
indeed . Team work is highly valued in this new company . I like our boss too . He is easy to get along with treats everybody with respect and appreciation . He's highly respected by all his employees .
that's great , that's good for a positive work environment and helps motivate employees . I wish my boss was like that .
true , take my former supervisor as an example . He was extremely controlling and overbearing . He always had to micromanage everything .
well , now you don't have to worry about that . This new place sounds really good .
Yes , The SARS epidemic is not under effective control yet . So I'd better not risk it .
Maybe it's a good things . If you don't have to go to Hong Kong , you can take a break and take things easy for a while .
You are right . Maybe we should work out a fitness plan and start to do more exercise . Sitting around in the office all day is no way of keeping fit .
Aw , that's sweet ! I knew your costume would be a success .
It's a success all right . The kids keep trying to catch me .
Yeah , I saw that . I thought you were playing a game with them .
Some game ! You try being tackled by ten kids at once !
I'd like to leave this bag with you .
OK , sir . Is there anything valuable or breakable in it ?
Well ... there is a necklace in it .
Would you mind taking the necklace with you , or leaving it at the safe deposit box ?
Well , don't bother . I'll take it with me . Will that be all right ?
Thank you , sir . Here is your tag . This cloakroom is open till 11:00 p . m . , could you pick it up by then ?
What do you mean by that ?
She has keen to buy something which is much cheaper .
I have a room registered in your hotel . My name is Charles Hill .
Just a minute , please .
Yes , a single room for March 28 .
What do you mean ? It's because it's much cheaper to buy liquor duty-free .
But why ? Why don't people like to buy shirts duty-free ? Or shoes ? I just don't understand why it's always liquor .
Well , it's because in most countries liquor has a higher tax on it .
You mean liquor has a higher tax than other things ?
Yes , of course . Didn't you know that ?
No , I didn't . How high is the tax ?
Well , it is different in different countries.But it's because of the high tax that buying liquor duty-free is such a good deal .
Why would the government want to tax liquor so much ?
Liquor is considered a luxury item.And also , it is considered as something that isn't very healthy.So if people want to buy it , the government thinks it has the right to tax it .
That's why a lot of people buy cigarettes here too , isn't it ?
That's fine . You must try this dish .
Could you tell me how this thing is cooked ?
It's fish steamed and served with our special sauce .
Is it good ?
Sure . It's a most popular dish .
I think I'll try it , and give me some green salad together .
We have two dressings for salad . Which one would you like ?
What kind do you have ?
We have French and Thousand Island .
I'll meet you at the Gate round about seven .
Where ?
At the Gate .
When , did you say ?
Round about seven .
Who's coming ?
Peter.Peter Brown , you know.Don ' t forget to bring the letter .
Sorry . I didn't quite catch what you said.There ' s a lot of noise outside .
I told you not to forget to bring the letter .
Um . Ten ?
Get in this door young man . It ’ s midnight , you are two hours past curfew .
I know , but it wasn ’ t my fault ! I told Jennifer she had to drop me off before ten , but she wouldn ’ t leave the party !
I don ’ t care ! You are grounded for life , mister !
Mom ! That is so unfair !
You know the rules and you broke them . No allowance and no TV for a week . I usually never ground you but this time I have to put my foot down !
What ! For being a couple of hours late ? You have to be kidding !
Is there anything you don't do in-house ?
Yes . If we don't have the facilities to deal with it here , we send it out for maintenance .
Is that more expensive ?
Mr . Mechanic , I'd like a nice Venezuelan blend this morning .
I think the Saudi Arabian will hit the spot today .
But really , maybe this can work . Everyone loves coffee , and everyone needs motor oil .
What's happened ?
I must meet someone at the airport tomorrow afternoon .
I'm sorry to hear that . May we meet the day after tomorrow ?
OK . I'll be free from nine to eleven . I'll be there waiting for you .
We'll discuss the contract in detail .
Sure . I'm really sorry for the trouble I've made .
Don ’ t say things like this . Please be confident . I think you still have the chance to win her love , unless you don ’ t love her anymore .
Don ’ t you think she is a bit out of my way ?
In some way , she is more modern .
If I do try to do anything , I ’ d only be sent off with a flea in my ear .
Take me to the airport , please .
Are you in a hurry ?
I have to be there before 17 o'clock .
We'll make it except a jam . You know it's rush hour .
There's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time .
I'll do my best .
Here's twenty dollars .
Do you have small bills ?
No . If you can't break it , keep the change . But can you give me a receipt ?
I hope so . I'm looking for some material for a paper I'm writing , and I'm not quite sure where to look .
I'll certainly try to help you . What topic is your paper on ?
My paper is on the influence of television on children .
There are several possible sources you might use for that topic . I suggest you use the computer and the computer will give you a list of every scientific journal that talks about children and television .
Frank has gone out with Lucy again .
What ’ s wrong with that ?
Busy with your work again ?
Not really . I'm expected to attend a meeting .
I would like to order 2 office-style cabinets and desk calendars . We want office-style cabinets in white . The catalogue number is 90 - f - 2356 .
How soon do you want it ?
Could you deliver it tomorrow ?
No problem .
Please handle the items carefully .
Certainly .
callous is a great Internet-based placement service that is available to you .
I don ’ t have access to a computer .
There is an area at the EDD Center that is set up with computers for you to make use of .
Is there anything else at the EDD offices to help me with my job search ?
We can provide you with information that will help you understand what is available . We also provide workshops .
If I go to EDD in person , what type of workshops might I find there ?
Our two most important workshops are Resume Writing and Interviewing .
What are some other places where I might look for work ?
Wow ! Besides The Cosby Show , I've never seen a black sitcom . What's this program ?
It's a drama called Soul Food . This channel is BET-Black Entertainment Television . It has black shows , news and commercials .
This show is like a black Friends .
BET has black shows that are overlooked by mainstream white TV .
An all-day pass is 30 dollars for adults and 20 for children .
Two adult passes , please .

I had a pretty strict upbringing , and my parents taught at an university so they have extremely high expectations for me .
Where did you go to university ?

What ’ s your plea ?
I am pleading not guilty .
But all the evidence points to you .
I am not the guilty party
What are you saying ?

Pretty good . I've made a few friends already .
Anybody I know ?

Thank you , I ’ ll pay next then .
Oh , I must be going now ; it was nice talking with you .
Check , please .
500 US dollars .
No kidding ! We have only 5 bottles of beer .
Maybe it was Dick .
I don't think so . Dick has been on the ball and he never does things like that .

No . This time I'll try Chinese wine .
What about Mao Tai , one of the most famous liquors in China ? It's good indeed . It never goes to the head .
Do people here drink a lot of liquors ?
Some do , some don't . Many people in the North are fond of liquors . I think it has something to do with the climate .
Yes , it has . Some Mexicans are crazy . They drink a lot of liquors even on hot days . Have you ever heard of " Tequila Sauta " ?
Yes , it's a very well-known kind of spirits in Mexico . People drink it with salt and lemon .
Right . It's very strong , just like alcohol . ( Frank sips Mao Tai . )
Yes , besides Mao Tai , we have Wu Liang Ye , Fen Jim and so on .

OK , and when shall I bring it here ?
About seven thirty.By the way , could you also bring me tomorrow's papers ?
I have four years study in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and it has given me a solid theory foundation . Moreover , I have worked at CAB Company for 4 years and got a lot of practical experience .
Great . Then what's your technical post title now ?
I am a senior mechanical design engineer .
Do you take the original certificate with you ?
Yes . Here it is .
Can you briefly tell me about one of your designs ?
I don't see any wrinkles or sagging skin ! You'd better stop being so ridiculous .
Anyway I think I need a nose job and some breast implants as well .
I think you need to get a brain surgery . Honestly speaking , you look charming .
I know what you mean . I just want to make myself more attractive .
You are fine the way you are . Besides , plastic surgery hurts .
Really ?
I am sorry , but we can't advance shipment . The manufacturers are fully committed . They have no stock on hand .
Can you find some way for an earlier delivery ?
How's this then ? We propose partial shipment . We can ship whatever is ready to meet your urgent need instead of waiting for the whole lot to get ready .
Sounds like a good idea .
We propose to deliver 50 % in June and the balance in Aug .
I'm afraid it gains a little .
By how many minutes ?
Do you have anything which can prevent wrinkles and freckles ?
What is your skin type ?
My skin is kind of oily .
This nutrition cream is for anti-wrinkling and whitening which is a newcomer brand .
How much is it ?
$ 60.The price is reasonable for its large quantity . What's more , there are some gifts attaching for you .
Sounds good . What are the gifts attaching ?
You can take one tonic or hand cream .
I will choose the tonic .
No problem . You can try this kind of gel which can prevent freckle , the effect will be better if you use this powder foundation applied with it .
So I am .
When did you get your passport ?
I got it last week .
How long is it valid ?
It's valid for 5 years . I am planning to do a doctor ’ s degree during my stay there .
Good . Good luck to you !
Does that mean you're going to take my advice ?
Yes . I'm looking for a position as a chef .
I might be able to help ...
I'm sure you have great connections .
We'd like to open another restaurant ... with you as the head chef and manager ...
Really ? You have that much faith in me ? And Giovanni agreed to it ? Does he know who I am ?
Yes . But you know him . He's just worried that you're not Italian ...
He's prejudiced , isn't he ?
No . He's afraid that no one will cook as good as his mother did .
Ah ! I know a way to convince him that Americans can make good Italian food !
How's that ?
I can help you . How much money do you make per year ?
I make around one hundred thousand dollars per year .

I'm thinking of travelling to Suzhou in July . Could you recommend some tourist programs for that ?
With pleasure . We arrange two kinds of tourist programs for Suzhou , a six-day tour by train and a five-day flying journey .
How much does a six-day tour by train cost ?
Five hundred yuan .
Does that include hotels and meals ?
Oh , yes , and admission tickets for places of interest as well .
That sounds reasonable . What about the five-day flying journey ? How much is that ?
Eight hundred and fifty yuan .
Covering all expenses ?
To tell you the truth , I don't think much of them .
You're becoming a real television watcher .
Wait for a moment . Mr . Bush.this is your bill , please sign your name here
Well , I think something must be wrong with my bill . I didn't have any laundry .
Yes .
How do you feel about it ?
As a reporter , he must have acute insight and language skills . At the same time , he must have good judgment , the respect for his job and tactical cooperation with others .
Can you work under pressure ? You know , people working here are all busy everyday since we're daily newspaper .
I would like to book a table for six tonight .
Sorry , sir . We have only double tables left .
What a pity . Can you recommend a nice restaurant near here ?
I told you so . I kept having problems with it yesterday . I don't know what's wrong .
Today I'm here to find out about paying in foreign currency . You do that here , I suppose ?
Yes , of course . What would you like to know ?
My nephew has told me about something called a ' timing deposit ' or something like that ?
A T-I-M-E , Time Deposit . You can chose from 5 different grades
Yes , I have . Here are my blouse , coats and stockings .
Anything else ?
Oh , yes . My husband also has some laundry . This is his suit and here is his pajamas .
Are they to be dry-cleaned ?
Oh , no . Only the suit and coat are to be dry-cleaned . I want to have my blouse tomorrow evening . And I'd like the collar and cuffs starched .
Yes , but not too stiff , right ?
Exactly . Is it possible to have my overcoat dry-cleaned , too ?
There are a few spots on it . I am afraid you will not have it tomorrow . Dry-cleaning usually takes three days .
Oh , no . I also need this tomorrow evening .
In that case , I suppose I could ask the dry-cleaner to clean up the spots for the moment , and have it well pressed . You might get it back on time then .
That's a good idea .
By the way , a cotton came off your shirt you gave me the day before yesterday .
Yes , I noticed it yet .
The laundry has sewed on a new button for you .
Oh , thanks a lot .
I am afraid the new one is not exactly the same as the others .
Never mind , it doesn't matter .
I want a job in which I can use English , I would also like to be able to have some responsibility in my work .
I really appreciate that I would expect my secretary to be able to work independently and take over some of my ordinary responsibilities , such as answering routine correspondence , taking phone calls for me and sometimes assisting me with personal affairs .
Yes , I see . In my previous job , I did typing and filing everyday .
Have you had any experience as a guide ?
Well , not exactly , but I have shown some of my foreign friends around Beijing .
Once in a while we have visitors from abroad and I would like to be able to ask my secretary to take them shopping and sightseeing .
Heard what ?
Deborah already had her baby .
I didn't know that .
I thought you knew .
I honestly didn't know .
The baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces .
That's good to hear .
Will you go and visit them ?
Of course I will .
I just wanted to give you the good news .
Have you paid the airport fee ?
Yes , and I have already gone through the safety inspection .
In that case , please get your passport and boarding card ready . Just wait in the terminal for twenty more minutes.You will hear the announcement .
What happened ?
You've just scratched my car . Oh , God , a paint was scratched off .
Where ? my car ?
No , mine !
Thank goodness !
I've just had it repainted .
That's terrible .
I am sorry to say this , sir , but you should've been more careful .
I apologize for that . But the space is too small .
What about the damage to my car ? What are you gonna do about that ?
Can we solve this later ? I am calling the insurance company .
Why ?
I'm going to take you to your school to register for classes .
That's right . I haven't done that yet .
You can choose classes that you like at the school office .
Really ?
Well , there are core courses and electives .
What do they mean ?
You've been sneezing a lot lately . Are you sick or something ?
No . Every spring time around April , I'm stricken with allergies .
I never have seasonal allergies .
Consider yourself lucky .
What are all the symptoms ?
Well , as you just saw , I sneeze a lot . Also , my nose becomes very runny , my throat sometimes itches , and my eyes start to water .
That doesn't sound good .
No , it's not . So you don't have any type of allergies ?
Well , I have a severe allergic reaction to alcohol . It runs in the family .
Everyone to some extent is allergic to alcohol .
I get it pretty bad . My whole face turns red , including my ears . My eyes become bloodshot , and I start to itch all over my body .
That's pretty bad .
Where do you live ?
I live up in Altadena .
The 264 will take you there .
It goes all the way there ?
I know for a fact that it goes to the station .
What street would I catch it on ?
If you go to Altadena Drive , you can catch it there .
I didn't know that bus went to the Gold Line station .
Yup , it does .
Well , thanks for letting me know .
Why ? What are they like ?
They're incredibly selfish . They ' re always up until the wee hours of the night playing their music so loudly that I have to wear earplugs in order to fall asleep !
Have you ever talked to them about it ?
I tried to introduce myself to them when they moved in , but they were so arrogant that I didin't want to ever talk to them again !
What did they say ?
They both just talk about how great they are all the time .
They soud like the neighbours from hell !
They are ! Besides being loud and arrogant , they're also terrible gossips . They're always talking about everybody else in the apartment .
I thought you didn't talk to them much .
I don't , but they talk so loudly that I can hear what they're talking about from my bedroom - and it's not very nice .
What do the other people in your apartment think about them ?
Most of my other neighbours are scared of them .
Maybe you should think about moving .
I can't afford to move right now .
Well , perhaps you should have a party and try to get to know them better . Maybe once you get to know them , they'll turn out to be more sensitive .
I think you're being a bit optimistic . If you met them , you'd understand .
I'd love to help you ! What is your budget for the dinner ?
She strikes me as being very sophisticated . Only the best will do for her .
Well , what do you think about our very own hotel restaurant ? It is very upscale , with a three-star rating .
I don't want to be cooped up in my own hotel tonight . How about another restaurant ?
The Gramercy Tavern is highly rated . It has great food and live jazz , but it's not cheap .
Yes , that sounds like a winner . Would you please call them to reserve a table ?
Well , not everyone wants to drink beer . Make sure there are some soft drinks and juice . Nothing's as refreshing as iced drinks on a hot day .
I don't think we need too much in the way of soft drinks , Two super bottles of Cola should cover everyone . What about wine ?
Just buy a cask of wine . Have you bought ice yet ?
No , once I fill the tub with beer , I'll get the ice . The beer will be cool if you put the tub under the ice . The cooler , the better .
I think a bottle of champagne would be a good idea . It's appetizing and tasty .
May I take your size ?
OK . I want it a bit close around the waist .
No problem .
How long will it take ?
About a week .
What ’ s the charge for the tailoring ?
All right . I graduated and got the degree of bachelor of economics from Nanjing University 4 years ago . My major is international trade .
Can you name some terms of payment ?
Is he really ?
Yes , he is . He loves the girl very much .
Who is he marring ?
A girl he met on holiday in Spain , I think .
Have they set a date for the wedding ?
What size do you want it to be ?
I want to have it the size of a page from an ordinary book .
Oh , I see , that's the size of 12 x 18cm . How many prints do you want to have ?
One is OK . How much does it cost ?
Let me see . Eleven yuan .
Here's twenty yuan .
Hi , I am sorry to say that your experience doesn't fit the job at all .
Sorry to hear that , but could you inform me why I failed ?
We'd like this course for two , please .
I'm afraid this course is for four persons .
Well , can't you make it for two only ?
I'm afraid not , sir .
I see . Well , what do you recommend then ?
I would recommend a soup with two or three small dishes .
Right , we'll have these three .
Would you like rice with your meal ?
No , thanks .
I ’ m going to the hospital .
What ’ s the matter ?
Professor Wang was hurt in a traffic accident .
That ’ s too bad . How are things now ?
what is it ?
well , you know how I've been working at the Economist as a proof-reader , right ?
yes .
well , the editor-in-chief heard that I had experience as an editor at another magadize and asked me if I was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him .
really ? That's fantastic ! Will you get a chance to do any writing ?
she said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that I could be in charge of the column until she came back .
wow ! That's really great news . How often does the magazine come out ?
it's a monthly magazine , but my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly .
are you looking forward to doing more editing work ?
yes , but I'm even more excited about getting my thoughts published again !
do you have any order forms here so that I can get a subscription to the magazine ?
I don't have any with me , but I think I could manage to bring a free copy home for you .
I'm really looking forward to reading your column .
me , too . Do you want to go out to celebrate my good news ?
sure , where would you like to go ?
I'm figuring out my budget .
What budget ?
I'm making a shopping budget , so that I don't spend too much money .
How much money can you spend ?
I can only spend $ 300 a month .
Why only $ 300 ?
I need to save the rest .
For what ?
I need to pay my bills .
Your budget is a good idea .
You can take the subway to get there
How long will I take it to get there ?
It ’ s takes only about 10 minutes
May I take a bus or a taxi to get there ?
You can take No . 1 bus or taxi
Excuse me . Sir . Where is the No . 1 bus stop ?
Pleas turn right at the traffic lights .
No , we have an easy-payment plan . One-third down , and the balance in six months .
Fine . Will you work out the details , please ?
Certainly . Would you sit here please ? I'll call our credit manager .
Thank you .
It's just a formality , but for hire purchase we usually require references .
What kind of references do you need ?
Perhaps your employer could supply us with one .
I'm sure he could , but I prefer not to bother him . Would my bank do ?
Yes , that's right . That's the poster of the The Witch .
May , I really regret watching it with you last night .
Did it scare you ?
Of course not . I just thought the movie was ... boring .
Boring ? Come on , you clutched to my arm all the time .
Well , I admit . The ghosts were scary .
I like scary movies .
That's Gucci's influence . I love science fiction movies !
Of course you do . They are silly stories just for little kids like you .
Don't call me kid . I am a grownup .
Do you dare watch scary movies with me tonight ?
Of course ! I can watch them without you !
I found it a garage sale once .
What a find ! So , how much does it cost ?
Well , because I like you ... ninety bucks .
Maybe they are still wet behind ears .
They are blind with bucks . Blind people are more easily conned , fo course .
Let me see . Would it be all right on Wednesday morning ?
That'll be fine .
Happy New Year , Steven .
Do you have any plans for the New Year holiday ?
My whole family are going to Hainan for visiting . What about you ?
Yep . And relive those good old high school days .
You don't sound too excited about going to your reunion .
I'm not . I get a stomachache just thinking about it .
Are you nervous about meeting up with your ex , Femi ?
I beg your pardon ?
I said I had been to the doctor the day before .
What did he say ?
He said I ' d got the flu .
Oh dear ! What did he tell you to do ?
He told me to stay in bed for ten days .
Ten days ? Would you please repeat it again ?
Did I hear about it ? I saw it happen .
Are you serious ?
I was there .
What happened ?
A man came into the bank with a gun .
That's insane .
I was so scared when I saw the gun .
Then what happened ?
He took the money and tried to get away .
Did the cops show up in time ?
Thank you .
Is that your wedding ring ?
I'm not married yet . It's my engagement ring .
Well , congratulations . When is the big date ?
In June .
Did you have the watch before getting the ring ?
Actually , we bought the ring together after I got the watch .
You did a fabulous job with the selection . It's gorgeous .
Thank you so much .
What kind of watch is it ?
It's a Tag Heer .
If you don't mind me asking , how much do they cost ?
This one is $ 1500 . But they range from $ 600 to $ 3000 .
That's why it looks so nice . I should have figured . You always get what you pay for .
Pretty well , thanks . Still feeling the effects of jet lag a bit , but last night I got at lease six hours of rest .
Great ! So , are you ready for a full day of shopping ?
Yep . Let's do it . I'm pretty excited !
I know a place that should be perfect . It's called the China Friendship Shopping Center and it's pretty much like an American mall - except with more variety . You can even buy a live chicken there if you want .
Live chicken ? Thanks , but no thanks . So ... tell me about bargaining . How can I do it like a local ?
Well . I'll be honest and say you'll never be as good at bargaining as a local person . You're a foreigner and the sellers can see that . But ... if you're smart , you can get bargains that are not too far away from the local price .
Cool ! Teach me !
For starters , you want to do a lot of scouting first . You've got to know what things cost .
Someone told me to go to a convenience store and see how much a soft drink or a tube of toothpaste costs . The idea is that by comparing the prices of those items , you can figure out the relative prices of everything else .
Well , your job is to compile and analyze financial information to prepare entries to accounts . You ’ re also responsible for preparing profit and loss statements and monthly closing and cost accounting reports .
And I represent ?
Our company just concluded a business transaction . You can help with documenting varies financial sheets involved in this transaction .
Ok , thank you .
We ’ re on our own tonight , dad ’ s taking mom out .
Out ? What do you mean out ?
You know on a date , they are going out to dinner .
Dad and mom ?
Yeah , they said they ’ re reviving the old tradition .
You mean this is going to be a regular thing ?
It's a good idea .
I want a Hamburger and ice cream . What about you ?
I don't like Hamburgers . They have no taste .
What about cheese cake or apple pie ?
I went bankrupt and I'm flat broke now .
If I can do anything for you , don't hesitate to let me know .
Wow , I can't catch my breath . You are running too fast , honey .
You just need more exercise .
Yes , but you need to slow down . This is jogging , not racing !
I don't care . I want to burn up my fat .
But running so fast is not good for people over forties .
Why ?
We are not as athletic as we were when young . Mild exercise is more suitable for us .
But I want to burn up more calories !
In fact , in order to burn up your fat , you must take it slowly for a longer time .
What's your excuse this time ?
Have I used the one that my sister is sick ?
Yes , twice last week .
Are you sure ? I thought I said it was my mother .
I don't think so . But it could've been .
Well . You can trust me this time . My sister is definitely sick . I'm just coming from the hospital . They say she might even die .
I don't buy your story . Try not to have any more sick relatives this week , all right ?
I'll do my best .
Just try to be a little more punctual in the future .
Certainly sir .
Do you know if there is Japanese restaurant near the hotel ?
Actually there ’ s one on the same street as this hotel .
Is it far ?
Really ? That's nice .
He usually keeps me posted .
I've been completely out of touch with my old friends .
It's hard to keep up contact when people move around so much .
I thought that I already told you that I am going with Mark to Alaska .
Are you kidding me ?
You know what ? You and I had no plans , so I made plans with Mark . What's the problem ?
We have been together for a year and usually , people who've been together a year , take their vacation together .
I don't think that I ever heard of that rule before . Any more rules that you would like to tell me about ?
Go on your vacation with Mark and when you come back , why don't you just move in with him as well !
He is all right . But I think he seems to have no back bone .
Why do you say that ?
yes , but I'm not sure which one to sign up for .
what kind of program are you looking for ? Full-time or part-time ?
I have to work during the day , so I want to find a part-time course that I can do in the evenings .
what kind of course are you looking for ?
I need to improve my English .
do you want a one-to-one private tutor or a group class ?
I think a one-to-one course will be too expensive for me , so a group class would be fine .
have you ever considered taking one of our online courses ?
I think I prefer face-to-face instruction better .
that's fine . If you want , you can sign up for a pre-sessional interview .
what's that for ?
one of our qualified teachers will interview you so that they can find a class that suits you best .
do you have a brochure about the course that I can take home to read ?
sure . Here's a brochure about out English classes that meet in the evenings .
I need a hat . Would you show me some ?
Certainly , here you are .
I like the black one . May I try it on ?
Of course . It fits you perfectly .
Yes , I thinks so . How much is it ?
It's forty-five yuan .
Can you make it much cheaper ?
It's such a nice change .
I really don't think this weather will last .
Yes , this is Julianne Horton , and I ’ m calling to arrange an appointment with Ms . McNeal .
Certainly , what day were you thinking of ?
How ’ s Thursday ? Does she have any time available then ?
Um . . . let me double check . . . unfortunately , she ’ s booked solid on Thursday , how does next Monday work for you ?
Actually , I ’ Ve got something scheduled on Monday.Can she do Tuesday ?
Sure , Tuesday ’ s perfect . May I ask where you ’ re calling from ?
Sure , Merton Financial Advisors .
Yeah . I do it once a week .
Is it very interesting ?
Sure . I get a lot of information and make many friends .
Thank you .
From reading over your resume , I assume your English is quite good . Have you had any experience in the writing field ?
No , I haven ’ t had any professional experience , but I have always been interested in creative writing .
Have you ever had a foreign instructor in English composition ?
Yes , my college teacher was an Australian . She was also our adviser on our English language newspaper . I was the editor for two years .
That ’ s very interesting . Tell me what you did exactly .
Well , I planned the layout of the newspaper and then I assigned various articles and columns to other students to write . I wrote the editorial each time .
What is your aim in going into the field of journalism ?
To be frank with you , I would like nothing better than to be an overseas reporter some day .
That can be a rough job , you know .
Yes , I know that . But I like adventure and excitement in my writing .
Well , working in an editorial office may not be exciting enough for you . What do you think ?
I would be glad to do routine work sometimes , if I could be assured of making advancements in the future .
I think this type of position would be a very good start for you . I am quite sure we can work something out for you , but I cannot give you a definite answer today . We will let you know within just a few days .
Hi Pete , how do you know my name ?
Do you see that girl in the red top ? She told me who you were .
Oh Andrea , the Spanish girl ?
Yes , that's her .
I met her last week at a party . Anyway , you must be from the United States ?
Actually I live in London , but my family lives in Seattle .
Oh , I am from London as well .
Where in London do you live ?
In Wimbledon - quite close to the tennis courts actually . Which is very nice because I love tennis .
I play tennis there every week . Shall we have a game one day ?
No , I ’ m not sure . I think about 65 mph , right ?
You ’ re not sure ? You were going at 90 miles per hour ! That ’ s 25 mph over the legal speed limit ! Have you been drinking ?
No , Officer , not at all .
Then how can you explain your behavior ?
Well , I guess I just wasn ’ t paying attention to the speedometer .
Not paying attention to the speedometer ? Why not ?
Um , because I was busy talking to my friend .
On a cell phone ?
Yes , I was using a cell phone . I just bought it , so I decided to give my friend a phone call to tell him about it . While I did that I also turned on the radio and was listening to one of my favorite songs , and eating some food I had bought at a fast food restaurant , and , um ... guess I had too many distractions .
Grades are based on many things
What counts the most ?
Actually I look at all of it and let's not forget class participation .
Do you grade on a curve or use percentages ?
Homework , attendance , and quizzes are sixty percent ; the mid-term and final are worth twenty percent each .
What if we miss something ?
I will allow one unexcused absence ; after that you need to contact me ahead of time .
Will you tell us if we are failing during the year ?
It's nothing serious . But I always have a headache , and I haven't slept properly for several weeks . I've also lost appetite and my eyes are burning .
Mm , you do look rather pale . Let me take your temperature . Would you put the thermometer under your arm , please ? Now , let me listen to your pulse . Mm , do you feel weak ?
Yes , I never seem to have any energy .
I'll give you a blood test . Would you roll up your sleeve ? Just as I thought . You're anemic . You'd better pay more attention to your diet . Eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables and food high in protein . And don't stay up late working . Try to get more rest .
Oh , do you really think so ?
Of course , otherwise you ’ ll just have to wait for hours .
We've been able to survey and track some of the information of our website users through some cookie technology , and it's surprising to see the results .
What kinds of hits are we getting on our company's website ?
From the numbers , it seems nearly half of the visitors who stumble onto our page pick up the link not from network browsers or search engines , but from our circular insert . That means our consumers are purposefully and actively seeking information about our products and services through the web format . Based on these findings , I am completely convinced the internet is the marketing power of the future !
You really think that many people turn to the internet to find product information.What about the old standbys of word mouth and print media ?
Well , I'm an English major , you know.So I came here to make sure I'm taking the right things .
Good . I think it's a good idea . Our department should require meetings like this .
I want to finish my degree in four years.So I don't want to forget to take classes I need . I have a friend who has to stay in college another year.She didn't know until recently . There were some classes she needed to take to graduate.She didn't know about them .
Yes , that happens .
I brought my transcript from my first year.Here . And here is the list of courses I plan to take in the fall .
Alright . Good . I see you've already taken six credits of your breadth requirements.You have one botany class and one chemistry class . And political science.So that's nine credits . Did you take English Composition 201 ?
No , I don't need to . I took Advanced Placement English in high school.So I'm not required to take composition .
Excellent . I see you have the 18th century poetry class for next semester.And the modern novel class . You haven't taken a Shakespeare class yet .
No , I thought I would take it later .
Actually , I recommend you take Shakespeare sooner rather than later .
Well , I suppose I could cross out the 18th century poetry class . I have to see when the Shakespeare class meets .
Let me look at the timetable.Shakespeare meets Monday , Wednesday and Friday at 11
I can take it then . I have that time slot free .
Good . I recommend it . Shakespeare is of course enormously important.We want our students to take the class as soon as they can.And Professor Friedman is an excellent teacher .
I'll take it then .
Tell me , Lisa , what made you decide to be an English major ?
I want to be an English professor in the future . I love studying literature , and I want to teach it .
Really ? That's great to know .
Yes . Have you ever been in one of his classes ?
I'm thinking about taking his class next semester .
He was a very easy teacher . Are you thinking of taking a class with him ?
I'm not sure because I really need to learn something , but I also worry about grades .
Grades are important , but don't you think that gaining the knowledge is important , too ?
I really need to learn this stuff .
He made everything so interesting that the time just flew by . Do you know what I mean ?
Yes , that sounds right for me .
Did you know that he came here last year after 10 years in the military ?
Yeah , I already knew that . That could be a good thing .
I would like to open another account .
What kind do you want to open ?
I want to open a savings account .
Do you have an account opened with this bank already ?
Yes , I do .
You can always transfer money from that account into your new one .
That would be great .
How much money do you want to transfer ?
I want to transfer $ 100 .
I ’ ll do that right now .
I don't feel like eating . And I cannot sleep well .
Do you have a fever ?
Yes , a low fever . I feel terrible . Am I dying ?
Certainly not . Take one of these white pills three times a day .
Before the meals or after the meals ?
Just me . I'm traveling alone .
And how many bags do you have ?
Just one carry-on and one that I want to check .
You must be going to some island to relax in the sun where all you need is a swim suit and a toothbrush .
That's right .
Well , you have fun .
It's a portable TV . It's a popular thing now .
Oh , that's new to me . So what's on everyday ?
News about current affairs , documentaries , music , movies , noncommercial ads and so on .
Is there anything interesting ?
Yes , there are something good and informative . I think that many people underestimate the value of TV in education .
I agree . Are there any commercials on the TV ?
Of course . Because the TV stations need to make money from commercials between the programs .
That makes a lot of sense . Does the TV work well ?
Not always . It depends on the transmission of the satellite signals .
I got it . Do you pay for the programs ?
How do you do , Mr.Black ? Very happy to see you .
Pleasure is mine.Here ' s my card .
Yes . It is also called Dragon Boat Festival .
Why are you celebrating this festival ?
We celebrate it to commemorate a great patriotic poet of China — Qu Yuan .
What do you do on that day ?
We'll have rice dumplings . What's more , there are also dragon boat matches in some places of southern China .
Yes , I am . I really don ’ t know anyone .
Did you just arrive in this country ? You look a little nervous .
No . I was here last semester , but I didn ’ t find out about this class in time . So I ’ m taking it this semester .
I took this course last semester too . Now I am taking it again !
How is it ? Did you learn anything here ? Why are you taking it again ?
Wow , you have a lot of questions ! I learned a lot . In fact , that ’ s why I am taking it again . I get lots of practice in speaking , and also in writing . I ’ m sure you ’ ll be glad you took this course . I ’ ll even help you study if you ’ d like .
Certainly . How much will you be exchanging today ?
How about 50,000 RIB . Would that be a problem ?
That ’ s a hefty amount . But that should have no problem at all . You should be aware that there is a ten-percent service charge , though .
Ten percent ! Now that ’ s hefty !
Wait a minute ... do you have an account with us ?
Yes I do; here is my account number .
For members , there is a small transaction charge , but it ’ s only 5 dollars per transaction . Any particular denomination ?
3,000 marks in hundreds and the rest in tens and twenty ’ s , please .
Yes . How much do you want ?
Fifty dollars . What is the exchange rate today ?
One dollar to five franc . Is that alright ?
Yes , please . and you can cash my travelers check . Can ’ t you ?
Of course we can .
I won ’ t to be here tomorrow . What are you business hours ?
10 o ’ clock in the morning to 2 o ’ clock in the afternoon .
Thank you .
I'm going to buy a CD .
Why not listen to music online ?
Then I will have to pay quite a lot to listen to music on line , isn't it ?
You can audition music on line , and you can audition it off line after downloading it , so you needn't pay for it .
I have downloaded one , but it still can't be listened .
In order to listen to music , you must have the necessary software .
Can you recommend some to me ?
Certainly . Realplayer is a good .
Can I download it ?
Yes , but you need install it after downloading so that you can use it .
It's very nice . There are only four people , and those girls are very kind and friendly .
Well , do you all major in the same subject ?
No , the other three girls major in a computer science , and they can help me a lot with the computer operating .
No , that ’ s not all your fault .
But you will miss your good chance . I ’ m So sorry
Yes , it's so cold .
Do you think the rain is going to let up soon ?
Yes , I think so . The rainy season will be over soon .
How long does the rainy season last ?
About two months .
I can hardly stand these wet and cold days . It seems that it doesn't bother you very much .
I'm used to this kind of days .
But I prefer warm weather .
Spring will come soon . And we will have some pleasant weather then .
Can I see your passbook and with your draft please ?
Sure ?
Let me just make sure . You want to withdraw one thousand dollars .
Palmistry ? What is that ?
It's when someone takes a look at another person's palm 4 to tell the future .
Oh , you mean palm reading 5 . I've seen that before , but I don't believe in it .
Are you sure ? I've read a lot about palmistry and I've been able to tell a lot of accurate things about a person from his palm . Do you want me to take a look at your hand ?
Really ? You've read books about it ? Ok , then . But only if you want to .
Ok , let's see , well , you've got a long life line , which is good , and the love line is strong ...
What else do you see ? Will I be successful ? Will I make a lot of money ?
Hmm , hard to say , wait , yes , it looks like you will do well in business , and your ambition will help you a lot , but ...
What ? What is it ? What's the matter ?
You seem to have a large gullibility line . You believe everything that you're told .
I had to blow my nose .
Did you have to blow right next to the phone ?
Did you hear that ?
Of course I heard that . I thought a plane had crashed into your house .
It wasn't that loud .
I will blow my nose sometime for you , and you'll see .
Okay . I'll take your word for it .
I thought you had an elephant in your house .
You're funny .
What did you say ? I think I've gone deaf .
It was a nightmare .
What ’ s up ?
Actually , the business trip itself was very successful . We arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ?
Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home , I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout .
This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ?
I am still waiting for their call .
This is just what I have in mind.Where are you planning to go ?
How about the Yellow Mountains ?
let ’ s start with you . How was yours ?
it was really busy . I had to work straight through my lunch break .
did you get to leave early then ?
my boss told me that I could either go home early or take a long lunch break another day , so I decided to wait and take a long lunch break another time .
it was nice of your boss to give you an option . My boss would never do that .
let ’ s get back to you . How was your day ?
it was horrible ! It was just one thing after another .
you look pretty upset . Are you ok ?
I ’ m fine . But I have bad news .
what ’ s that ?
I got sacked today .
you ’ re kidding ! How did that happen ?
well , I was late to work today . It was the third time I was late this week .
how late were you ?
only about 5 minutes .
you got fired for being a few minutes late ?
my boss is really picky about that . He never arrives late , usually works over-time , and always gets his work done on time .
I would like the round-way ticket to Shanghai on December 10th .
Lady , let me check . Do you want the morning or the afternoon flight ?
What's the departure time ?
2:30
Well , the afternoon will be fine .
First class or economy ?
First class will be preferred .
Well , afternoon flight on December 10th to Shanghai . May I have your name , please ?
My name is Janice . Well , I book this ticket for Nova , the marketing manager of Pineapple Computer Company . Where can I get the flight ticket ?
Surely of course .
Here is the film . Can I get my pictures tomorrow ?
Sure .
Yes , sir . Where to ?
The city square , please .
Are you in a hurry ?
Yes , I have to be there to meet a friend at 5 thirty pm . So we're sure we can get there on time ?
I'm afraid not , sir . Generally we can , but you know how it is in the rush hour now .
I see . Here's the extra 5 $ for you if you can get me there on time .
All right . I'll do my best .
Oh.we made it . Thank you . How much do I own you ?
The reading on the kilometer is 12 $ .
Here's the money , keep the changes , please .
Do you need a receipt ?
And we're going to have summer vacation .
Yes.What will you do this weekend ?
The Cross Bakery building ? Oh sure . You're actually walking in the opposite direction .
Oh , you're kidding ! I thought I was heading east .
No , east is the other direction . To get to the Bakery , you need to turn around and go three blocks to Broadway . When you get to the intersection of Broadway and Elm , you hang a left . Go straight down that street for half a block and then you'll see the building on your left .
Okay , let me see if I've got that . I need to go down Elm until I hit Broadway , then I make a left and the building is on my left hand side . Is that right ?
Yeah , you've got it . Do you want me to show you the way ?
Thank you very much for your evaluation . I also like this job very much .
I want to know your earliest available entry time .
Oh , let me think ... Maybe two months later .
It's too late . If you could get the job , could you start a little earlier ?
I'm sorry I can't , because I haven't finished my thesis .
What a pity !
When do you usually require the new employee to start ?
Within two weeks , because the new employees need to receive induction training .
I will make an arrangement for it .
I hope you can come to our company to work .
I will give you an exact reply as soon as possible .
OK , I will keep this position for you for one week .
That's right . I can already see the Palace Garden on the left .
And here is Buckingham Palace ! Look , isn't it beautiful ? It is much bigger than I imagined .
The bus is turning right to Buckingham Gate . And now we are joining Victoria Street .
Yes we are going towards Westminster Abbey . I can see it now ! Look to your right .
I can see it . The bus is stopping . I think we will be able to go inside .
This is amazing . I'm glad we decided to take this bus tour . So where next ?
I guess we should see Big Ben soon .
Yes . It is just round the corner . Oh , can you see the London Eye ? Look straight and to your right .
Look at this bridge . We will soon be crossing the Thames .
This is Lambeth Bridge . We will then loop back and cross the river again on Westminster Bridge .
Oh right ... you know , my friend Eric is a DJ . Maybe he would like to play with us .
Hmm ... does he have a good ear for hip hop music ?
Good afternoon . Can I help you ?
I've got this important letter to send to Hainan . Can I send it by registered mail ?
Certainly .
How much will I have to pay ?
Two yuan , please .
Here are the letter and the money .
Wait a moment . It seems that your letter is overweight . Let me weight it .
Is it overweight ?
I'm afraid it is . So you will have to pay two yuan extra . The total charge is four yuan .
All right . Here is the money .
Here are the stamps and your receipt .
What shall I do with the receipt ?
You can keep it until the addressee tells you that the letter has been delivered . It is the proof that you sent the letter if it fails to arrive .
Thank you .
Here is my card . Can I have them delivered to this address ?
Sure . You can go to the front desk to ask for more help .
How dreadful !
Look at the view from the window .
Oh , dear . That ’ s terrible . Not at all what I expected .
It ’ s awful , isn ’ t it ?
I can ’ t bear to look at it . I ’ m rather disappointed .
I'd like that very much .
How does 7:30 sound ?
Yes , Mr . Smith ?
Is my VCR ready ?
It is called Energy Collector .
Look at your right-hand . Is it the zone of the Lost Maya Kingdom ?
Maybe . Oh , I see the Jungle Flying Train . I once rode it . It was very exciting .
I want to have a try later .
Me too . Daniel , look at your left side . Can you see the Air Force Ants ?
Wow , that's my favorite . It's like a superman shooting right up into the sky .
Good , you can make your dream come true here .
Of course . After this , I want to show you to the Haunted House .
So you can prove you are a man .
Bingo !
What kind of cottons are they ? May I see your list ? Ah , machine prints .
Yes , mainly prints . There are a few plain as well . Here they are .
I see . And the quantities .
200 rolls of each . Make it 200 rolls for each sample .
How many rolls altogether ?
Twenty prints and five plain . That makes 5,000 rolls in all .
Six weeks , did you say ?
Yes , five to six weeks .
We could manage the plain rolls in six weeks . The prints might be put off to eight weeks .
Eight weeks ? We can wait that long .
That's the best we can do just now , I'm afraid .
Can't you make it seven weeks for the prints ?
What about taking the prints in two shipments ? Two thousand rolls in seven weeks , and the remained a week later .
That might be acceptable . I shall have to cable our Beijing office to get their approval . You can definitely supply in the time you've given me , I suppose .
Yes , I'll see that you get those delivery . Shipping by ' S . S . American ' as usual , is that all right ?
That's right .
When can we expect your confirmation of the order ?
As soon as I hear from Beijing , that will be either Friday or Saturday .
And it's a long one . I have Monday off . It's Memorial Day or something like that .
Yep . It's the kickoff of the barbecue season . We're invited to a grill party in the park tomorrow .
Sounds good . What do we need to bring ?
We need to buy some buns for the hot dogs and hamburgers , and I'm making potato salad .
And then what ?
And then I ’ m moving to Florida where I can play golf all day , every day !
That sounds boring to me .
What do you plan on doing after you retire ?
Yes , I think I will do something new . I ’ Ve always wanted to be a teacher . I ’ m willing to begin studying to teach .
As I have some administrative experience from my last job , I may use my organizational and planning skills in the future .
How do you plan to accomplish this ?
By doing everything necessary and for further study .
How long would you like to stay with this company ?
How long I will stay with the company depends on whether the company and I are satisfied with each other .
What do you think of this industry's outlook in five years ?
I'm not sure when it started . But I know it's older than me . As a young boy , I used to eat here a lot .
Oh , it's interesting . Dad told me you brought him here when he was young , too . Now , it's my turn .
Yeah . We are the VIP customers here . So , what do you want to eat today ?
I'd like to eat a hamburger and a bottle of coca-cola .
Hey , kid , that's wrong . It's a Chinese restaurant . Let's eat something traditional .
Then there is nothing particular I'd like to eat . Grandpa , what's your favorite here ?
The Chinese rice pudding . Your father loves it , too . You wanna try ?
Sure . Is it sweet ?
Yes , of course . But I think they can make you a salty one , too .
Great , I want it spicy .
Come on . Don's go too far .
I want it to be special . And you know that I always like hot food .
What time is check-in ?
12:00 . You have to wait for a while .
OK .
Well , sir . Come with me . I will show you the waiting room . You must be tired . Have a short rest there . We will call you later .
I ’ m afraid that ’ s not my cup of tea . I just find skin-diving attracting .
I'm sorry , but she won't have any openings until 11:00 , unless there's a cancellation .
Would 1 : OO p . m . be convenient ?
Why are you so pessimistic ?
Because it's impossible to improve listening level within a week .
Only for this reason ?
Yes , I think my vocabulary and reading comprehension are not very bad .
Don't worry about it . Practice makes perfect . I will lend you some listening materials , so that you can practise more before the exam . I believe you can pass the exam with good preparation .
I go to bed at ten and get up at six .
That's helpful for your health .
I'm doing great .
What movies have you seen lately ?
I saw Forrest Gump the other day .
What type of movie is that ?
The movie type is drama .
I can't believe you are watching movies . The weather is great . You should be outside .
I hate the hot weather . I'd rather stay indoors with the air conditioner .
What else do you like to do besides watching movies ?
I like to play computer games , read books , go shopping , and play pool .
Out of those what is your favorite ?
My favorite is to play computer games .
What is your favorite computer game ?
My favorite is Diablo . It used to be Star Craft , but it is getting a little old .
If you like to play so much , when do you ever exercise ?
Although I hate to exercise , I go jogging at least twice a week .
That's pretty good . By the way , what are you doing next Saturday ?
I am going to go to the bookstore .
I am having a party Saturday night at my house . If you have time , you should come .
That sounds like fun .
Great . I'll see you on Saturday .
Leave the details of making the offer up to me . What were you thinking you should offer ?
I absolutely must have this house and will pay three hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more .
It is best to start a little low on the first bid to allow for a counter-offer . How about offering three hundred and twenty thousand dollars ?
I hope that the owners aren ’ t insulted by that offer .
Your offering price is not out-of-line . The owners will either take it or make a counter-offer .
Does it usually take very long for the owners to get back to you with an acceptance ?
It usually doesn ’ t take very long for owners to respond to an offer .
Should I be in touch with my bank to tell them to get the loan papers ready ?
It ’ s quiet and clean . I love the color scheme .
We have the room color designed for our guest .
Not bad.We have had a big meeting today , remember ?
Oh , yea . I forgot.So how did it go ?
Pretty well . I think the boss liked my ideas .
Great , so what happens now ?
It was so fantastic I didn ’ t really want to come home .
Did you happen to meet someone ?
How did you know ?
You always act like this when you ’ Ve fallen in love . Who is he ? How did you meet ?
His name is Tony and we met my first night in Pathos . He works with my sister who lives there .
Was it love at first sight ?
Not really . I wasn ’ t looking for a holiday romance , but my sister told me that she had promised him that she ’ d set him up on blind date with me . I didn ’ t think I ’ d have anything to lose , so I went .
And ?
Let ’ s just say that by the third date , we both realized that we had fallen in love .
That happened quickly ! Are you going to see him again ?
Luckily , his company has a position available here , so he ’ s going to see if he can get relocated .
It sounds like he is madly in love with you . Are you ready for such a serious relationship ?
Hi , Kathy . Have you had lunch ?
Not yet . And I ’ m really hungry now .
I ’ m starving , too . There is a new Chinese restaurant close by . Do you want to go there for lunch ?
Why not ?
It ’ s my treat this time .
Sure . We've got a lot to do in a short time . We're planning to shut the line at midday on Wednesday and start up again at 6 pm the following day . We might need to extend the shut by about six hours .
Our production people won't be happy about that . We've got a full order book at the moment . Is there any way you could speed things up ?
What happened that you didn't get it done ?
I had to watch a football game instead .
Well , you had more than one day ; couldn't you have fit it in on another day ?
Yes , I think so .
Either way , I only allow one missed assignment per semester . When will you be turning the make-up in ?
I'll make it up next week .
Fine , but it cannot happen again if you want an “ A ” in the class .
OK , I can do that .
Oh don ’ t worry , I ’ ll be fine .
But what will you do if you need to know the price of something ?
If I need to know the price , I ’ ll just look at the label .
Ok , but what will you do if you want to check the size of the clothes ?
I'll try them on .
And what will you do if you don ’ t have enough cash ?
it's beautiful . Enjoy it while it lasts . It's supposed to get cold tomorrow .
what's the weather forecast for tomorrow ?
it's supposed to snow early tomorrow morning and then tomorrow afternoon there's a chance of freezing rain .
that doesn't sound pretty .
do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
well , I was going to drive to Birmingham to see some friends .
you might want to change your plans . With the cold and wet weather that we're supposed to have tomorrow , the roads are going to be rather slippery .
I suppose I should . I don't like driving in dangerous weather conditions . Do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
I just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon .
if you're lucky , it'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day !
if that happens , then I'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies .
that sounds like fun .
hey , look outside ! It's started to drizzle !
it will be a rock and roll band probably . He ’ s a very good guitarist .
can you play a musical instrument ? If you can , he might ask you to join the band .
I can play drums , but I haven ’ t played for a while . I ’ m not sure I ’ d be good enough to play in a band .
I wish I could play a musical instrument . I love music .
nowadays , you can be a DJ . You can mix dance music . You don ’ t need to be able to play musical instrument or sing .
I'd love to try it.but the equipment is expensive and it was still take a lot of practice .
you know , you could probably get a computer program that would help you . You already have a computer , so you could use that to help you mix some music .
I want to think about it for some time .
Please , honey , I have made proposals to you fifteen times .
I know . But your way doesn't touch my heart .
Oh , god , please tell me how .
I can't tell you .
OK , I want you to be happy when we are together , and when you are sad , I would always stay with you .
When I am angry and want to beat someone , you stand there and let me do what I want . Would you ?
Yes , I would . Thanks for being in my life .
Yes , sir . What's the matter ?
Could I possibly have a room change ? My room is right next to the street , and it's much too noisy .
Well , we are rather full , sir . I'm not sure if I'll be able to find a vacant room .
Could you please try ?
Playground . We're having sports for today's outside class activities . All my classmates have already got there .
What are you going to play ?
Some of us will play basketball and some volleyball .
Firstly , we can provide our meeting agenda before he comes . And then on the day when he is coming , we wait for him at the gate of our company's gate .
Well , that's right . How about on a formal occasion ? What should I say to show my gratitude ?
It's an honor and a privilege to receive a visit from such a distinguished group .
And then , what should we do next when you meet the guests ?
Maybe we should send them to the reserved hotel for a short break , meanwhile we can also raise a question on what they want to have and know .
Hi , Rita , I ’ m just looking for a pair of shoes . I won ’ t be here for long .
Why not ? When I go shoe shopping , I have so many options for sneakers that I spend awhile looking at all of the choices .
That ’ s my problem . I don ’ t have a lot of options .
So how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ?
Well , first of all , I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection .
Well , you ’ re in the right store . If they don ’ t have it , no one will .
I need to hire you .
What do you need me for ?
I need you for my court date .
What kind of case do you have ?
I ’ m being charged with a felony .
I can help you with that .
What is your price ?
I charge $ 150 an hour .
I can ’ t afford that .
That ’ s my rate .
Yes . I've received this Remittance Advice from the bank .
Could I take a look at it , please ? Let me just check these details ... right .
Mr CK Chen contacted me this morning and asked me to come in for the remittance .
I've got the details here . 10,000 RIB sent by Mr CK Chen from Guangzhou . Could I see some ID ? You passport , for example ?
Here you go . Can I deposit some into my account and take some in cash ? I need 1,000 RIB for my expenses , you see .
He isn't a man of good taste for clothes , is he ?
He is , but I didn't mean that . His daughter bought him a tie as a Father's Day gift , and he was very happy to wear it and show it off to us in the office .
It must be hard being a father .
No , it's great being a father , seeing your children growing up and loving you and admiring you .
Hi . I would like to make a reservation on this Friday .
OK . What kind of room do you want ? We have single rooms , twin rooms , double rooms and suites available on Friday .
I want a single room with ocean view . Do you have one ?
Let me check . Yes .
OK . I will take it .
When do you check in ? How long are you planning to stay ? Do you have any special requirements ?
I guess I am going to arrive at 9:00 in the morning and I would like to leave at 200 in the afternoon on Sunday . Please give me a room away from the elevator . I hate noises while I am sleeping .
I'm afraid you're going in the opposite direction . Go back the way you came , and take the second turn on the left . The museum is straight ahead , right in front of you .
Will it take me long to get there ?
Well , it's about fifteen minutes ' walk .
Which bus goes there ?
You may take a No . 34 bus . And the subway can also take you there .
Thank you very much .
Do you want the truth ?
Of course , I do .
Well , you really didn't do all that well .
How bad did I do ?
To be completely honest , you failed your test .
How ?
There were a number of reasons .
What were they ?
Basically , you just can't drive .
Can I have another try ?
Yes , I ’ Ve been got all his albums and most of his films on DVD . I adore him . He ’ s my idol .
How come you don ’ t have all of his films on DVD ?
Some of his early films are hard to find nowadays , especially the ones where he only played a bit part .
I see . I ’ m sure you ’ ll find them one day . I see you also have several poster of him .
Yes . These posters are new . I bought them last week and put them up on my bedroom walls yesterday .
Are you a member of his fan club ?
I was , but then I discovered you can find out everything for free on the internet , so I ’ m not a member now .
Did you see the interview with Andy Lau in cosmopolitan magazine last month ?
Of course ! I bought two copies .
The post office.Sorry . I ’ m not sure .
It's cloudy .
Is it going to rain today ?
I doubt it .
What do you need to buy ?
I need to look for a new bedroom set .
Where are you going to go look for one ?
I have absolutely no idea .
You don't know where you want to look for one ?
No , I'm not sure where they sell nice bedroom sets .
Do you want to know where I got mine from ?
Yes , because I love yours .
I purchased mine from IKEA .
Is IKEA affordable ?
Just take your clothes off from the waist up and put this gown on , with the opening in the back .
What should I do after that ?
You need to come over here and face this plate .
Am I standing the right way ?
I will need your arms raised to shoulder height .
Am I doing this the right way ?
Everything you are doing is perfect .
Are you going to leave ?
I am just getting behind this screen . You need to take a deep breath , hold it , and then breathe normally .
Is that all there is to it ?
Yeah . I am too .
Where did you want to go for lunch ?
I was thinking we should just go to the cafeteria .
I don't think I ever got food from the cafeteria .
I actually like the food there .
Does the cafeteria sell a lot of different food ?
They have anything you want .
I was thinking about getting some Chinese food .
I bought some chow mein at the cafeteria . It tasted great .
We can eat at the cafeteria .
Certainly . The product has a two-year guarantee . If it breaks down during that period we offer a replacement unit completely free of charge . Our products are very reliable but we recommend you take out an extended warranty . This covers you for a further two years .
I see . What does that include ?
It covers all parts and labour , except for normal wear and tear of course .
What sort of response time do you guarantee ?
Our engineers are on call 24 hours a day . We guarantee someone will be with you within four hours , but in practice it's often much sooner .
Are there any exclusions ?
Good . How about you ?
Not bad , thanks for asking .
Have you been on the bus for a while ?
Only about fifteen minutes .
Do you ride this bus often ?
Not really , I usually drive .
You have a car ?
Yes , I do .
So why aren't you driving it ?
Once our President lowers gas prices , I'll be driving again .
You don't need to introduce yourself , Yang . You're famous .
Well , thank you very much but I thought l'd try and chair the meeting by the rule — at least for a while .
OK , OK !
Now , I'd like to get things under way . The main topic on today's agenda is the development of a U . S . sales strategy for the new EBB . I'd like to hear all of your ideas , Mr . Wall , you seem in top form today . Could you start the ball rolling ?
Uh , oh , sure . Well , I think we should keep in mind that the key to good sales is advertising .
Well , that's kind of obvious .
Give me a break , Mr Yang .
Yes . The reservation under Mr . Watson .
Ah , yes , a table for four at 8
Em , no , thanks . I think we'll go straight to the table , By the way . may I check my overcoat here ?
Certainly , sir . We'll keep it in the cloakroom for you . Here is your number . When you leave , show it to the waiter behind the counter , please .
Thank you . Could you show us to our table now ?
Would you please follow me , please ?
Thank you .
I don ’ t think so .
Why is that ?
The government will never fulfill their promise .
Hi , Steven . What's new with you ?
Not too much . I'm looking to rent an apartment .
Why ?
I dislike my roommate . He really turns me off .
What happened ? Did you have a fight ?
No . He likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room .
I hate that , either . Did you tell him your feelings ?
Yes . But he doesn't care . I really wouldn't want to move , but I simply can ’ t stand him .
Don't mention it.Don ' t forget to take your daughter along next time .
Your main job is serving the clients and giving them what they want .
What other things do I need to know ?
You'd spend 30 % of your time on the computer . You may be bored with a job like that .
Sure . What is it ?
Could you run over to the store ? We need a few things .
All right . What do you want me to get ?
Well , could you pick up some sugar ?
Okay . How much ?
A small bag . I guess we also need a few oranges .
How many ?
Oh , let's see . . . About six .
Anything else ?
Yes . We're out of milk .
Okay . How much do you want me to get ? A gallon ?
No . I think a half gallon will be enough .
Is that all ?
I think so . Have you got all that ?
Yes . That's small bag of sugar , four oranges , and a half gallon of milk .
Do you have enough money ?
I think so .
Well , let's try a size ten . ( He gets another pair and the customer tries a shoe on . ) Looks like a perfect fit .
Not really . It pinches my toes .
I'm sure they'll be fine once you break them in .
I don't know ... well , I guess I'll take them , since you don't seem to have anything better .
I'm here to see about a Fixed Asset Loan .
OK , are you already an account holder ?
Yes , I am . But I'm not sure if I'm eligible .
To find out if you are eligible for our Fixed Asset Loan , we will have to look at various aspects of your business , such as your long-term business prospects , your cash flow , your profitability , your capital structure ...
For my credit worthiness ?
Yes , I want to buy a suit .
What about the red one ? It's the best seller .
Yeah , it's quite cute . I don't think it will fit me . I would prefer a darker color . Have you a black one ?
Yes .
Oh , good . Transfer , please .
Sure .
Please let me know when we get there .
It sounds like you're from out of town .
As a matter of fact , I'm from Taiwan .
I'm sure you'll like Fisherman's Wharf . It's a popular tourist spot . Be sure to try the seafood there .
No problem . But how ?
I will open the suitcase and you read through the list .
Ok . I am done . You have nothing on the list left behind . But I suggest you take sneakers with you .
Why ?
It is necessary for you to walk on the street . Otherwise , it will be not good to wear high heeled shoes .
That makes sense . I will do it .
You do need to take some medicines with you . Just in case .
It provides breads and butter of your family . Besides , it simulates you to purse noble dreams ,
Why do you want to work for us ?
Of course , that's my job . Oh , dear . What's happened ?
Well , it's eaten my card ! It won't give it back !
I see ... calm down , don't worry . May I ask what were you doing when it took your card ?
Yes . I was only entering my PIN . I'm terrible at remembering it , I'm so forgetful , you see .
Mmmm ... and exactly how many times did you enter it , please ?
Maybe three times . As I said , I always forget it .
Ah ! Don't worry ; it's just a security measure . If someone uses a card and cannot get the right PIN after three attempts , the bank keeps the card in case it's stolen . Just contact the bank and we'll get it back to you .
Oh , I see . So if I call my branch they can sort everything out for me ?
Yes , they'll be happy to help . Believe me , it happens to many people .
Sure . We're on a pretty tight schedule , but we should be able to finish it just on time .
Are all of your team members on schedule ?
A few of the graphic designers are a bit behind in their work because of computer problems .
How have they decided to deal with that ?
They've agreed to work over-time until it's finished . They've even decided to come in on the weekend .
That's true dedication . I'm impressed . When is it due ?
We agreed that the deadline was next Friday .
Right . Well , given that your colleagues are working so hard on this project , I suppose we could change that deadline to Monday morning , I won't have time to look over it on the weekend anyway .
That'd be very helpful . An extra weekend is all they really need . Thanks .
That's alright . Make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the new deadline .
I will .
I know you have a tight schedule , so I won't take up more of your time . Have a good evening .
Most normal little girls go wild over Barbie dolls .
That sounds good . Let me see one .
Here's the latest model — Digital Barbie .
Oh , she's nice . How much is she ?
Why , she's only $ 29.95 .
Well , that's reasonable . I'll take it .
Excellent . Would you like anything else ?
No , thank you .
The total will be $ 32.42 . Will that be cash ?
Oh , cash will be fine .
We'd like to have break fast in our room tomorrow ; Would you please arrange it for us ?
Sure .
Shall I make an order now ?
You don't have to . This is your knob menu.Just tick off the items you want for breakfast . write down the time and hang it outside the door before you go to bed tonight .
What !
That's the cutest little doll I've ever seen in my life !
Chill out . It's just Kenny from South Park .
What park ? You found a doll in a park ? Gross !
South Park is a popular cartoon . You're so out of it , Jen
Yes . Go to the next corner and turn left onto Center Street . Walk three blocks to Second Avenue and turn right . Walk two more blocks and you'll see City Hall on the left .
I'm sorry . I didn't follow you . Could you please repeat that ?
Okay . First , go to the next corner and turn left onto Center Street .
Uh-huh .
Then , walk three blocks to Second Avenue an turn right . Are you with me so far ?
Yes . I'm following you .
Then , walk two more blocks an you ’ ll see City Hall on the left . Have you got all that ?
For over forty years . The original company Davies Engineering - was founded in 1960 by the Davies brothers in a small workshop near Manchester . They closed down the workshop in 1980 and opened up a new factory in Leeds .
When did it become CABS ?
In 1997 - when it was bought by a German company . They set up two more business in the UK .
What does CABS stand for ?
I just have some cereal each morning .
You're supposed to always have a hearty breakfast .
I don't always have time to make breakfast .
It's easy to make a quick breakfast .
What do you have for breakfast ?
When I need to make a quick breakfast , I just make some oatmeal , toast , and OJ .
That's a good idea .
It's not time consuming at all .
It doesn't take much time to make ?
Would you like me to make something ?
Hello , I'd like to talk to someone about making a withdrawal .
You can withdraw money from your account either over the counter or via the ATM .
Yes , but the problem is that I have a Savings Account with you , and I need to take some money from that . Do I really have to give 90 days notice if I want my money ?
Actually , you only need to give 7 days notice if you wish to withdraw funds . Of course , you will lose some interest due to the withdrawal .
I am the manager here . You can complain to me . How may I help you ?
Here is the thing . I was woke up by strange noises of the telephone several times last night . Even I unplugged it , it wouldn't stop beeping . I am also not satisfied with the housekeeping service in my room . So I want to change to a cleaner and quieter room .
Yes .
Did you use to work at NYU ?
Yes , I did .
Oh , did you know Hugh Young ? He was a music student .
Hugh Young ? Didn ’ t he use to wear a funny yellow jacket all the time ?
Yes . And he used to play the piano with a jazz group at the university .
I remember Hugh . Most people thought he was a little ... uh ... peculiar . Do you know what he ’ s doing now ?
Yes , he ’ s a millionaire in Houston now .
A millionaire ? As a jazz musician ?
Oh , no . He ’ s an executive for a large computer company . I saw an interview with him on TV yesterday . They were asking his opinion about future uses for computers .
It's my honor , Mr . Mike . By the way , how can I know whether I am accepted or not ?
We hope to make a decision in the next few days . We'll notify you of our decision by mail , is this convenient for you ?
Yes . Thank you very much . I am looking forward to hearing from you .
Good luck to you , good-bye .
Can you say it again slowly ?
Pam and I are wondering if you'd like to go to the mall with us .
Oh , I see . I'll have to sink about it .
Sink ?
Oops . I meant , " think "
Mary , you're going to have to work on your pronunciation .
I know .
Oh , that's right . And the general manager asked me to report the company's sales for last year at the meeting .
By the way , the meeting will be held in your office .
OK , thank you very much .
Saturday ? Oh , I have a previous engagement .
What a pity ! Then how about Sunday ?
I've already got plans , too .
Then when do you think we could go out together ?
How about Friday ? Only in that day can I arrange it .
OK . Any time on Friday will be OK with me .
$ 10 .
I have seen this cheaper in other places .
There is a supermarket in Kensington High Street . I'll come and give you a hand .
That is good of you .
Here , take one of these trolleys . What do you want exactly ?
I'm after things to stuff dumplings with , like Chinese cabbage
The fruit and vegetables are over there .
Pork . Where's the meat counter ?
Good ! Have you got the recruitment information on marketing ?
Yes . I have found some through different channels .
Really ? That's great ! Tell me .
OK . The first piece of job information I got was from the Internet , and it is about selling medicines .
What do you think of this job ?
I am not familiar with the medicine industry , and I don't think it fits me well .
Then how about the others ?
Another is about electronic commerce , and its products are mainly large machinery equipments .
I have heard about electronic commerce , and many people say it has good prospects for development .
I also feel it's nice . I want to give it a try .
Come on ! I believe you will succeed .
Thanks . You can also seek job information on the Internet .
Yes , I'd like to see that . What does it clean exactly ?
It washes the solvent off all the metal parts - the blades , trays etc . - and then sends it back into the system .
What does the unit consist of ?
Any other discomfort ?
Yes . Sometimes I can notice a constriction in the chest and shortness of breath after a fit of sneezing . And I often suffer from a running nose with a profuse watery discharge .
Does it occur seasonally or all year round ?
It has been seasonal during these past three years .
Are you sensitive to other things ?
Yes , things like seafood and penicillin-type drugs .
OK . Let me examine your nose . According to your case history and the examination , I believe that it's allergic rhinitis .
What useful treatment can you offer ?
Yeah . He's known as a sly dog . He's done many people in .
He hits below the belt .
No , I don't think she's that strong-minded .
But she took her luggage away with her .
no . what's it like ?
it's got its own library , theatre , swimming pool , and a guest house . The house itself has about ten different rooms that are all hooked up to computers so you can get things done in each room through
would you want to live there ?
I think his house is fantastic , but I wouldn't want to live there . You would have to hire one or two people to clean all the rooms in the house , plus a few people to take care of the gardens , and pro
what's your dreamhole like then ?
my dream home is actually just a small cottage in a quite village in England .
would you want to buy an old cottage or build a new one yourself ?
old homes are great because they've got character . I think that's important .
it that why you wear second-hand cloths as well ? Because they've got character ?
no , that's just because I don't have enough money to buy new cloths all the time !
I see . If you lived in an old house , would it be decorated in a modern way ?
Fantastic ! I enjoy clubbing , especially those clubs with live bands . The only fly in the ointment is that the air is bad , full of smoke , and the music is too loud , so conversations are not really possible . Once I nearly got burnt by a cigarette .
How did that happen ?
A wild dancer dropped it on my left foot and said nothing about it . If I had drunk enough and I would have had the bold to punch him in the face .
Yes , I ’ m new .
Is this your first year in college ?
I transferred from another school .
Where did you transfer from ?
I was at PCC before .
Why did you transfer ?
I was going to go here first , but my grades weren ’ t good enough .
Did you like it at PCC ?
PCC is an incredible school .
Well , I wish you luck here .
Click your right key of mouse and choose QQ Zone .
Well , I have to provide some of my information , right ?
Yep ! The nick name for your zone , address , gender and so on . Some of them are privacy , so you have the right to keep secret here .
All information is filled in and now I can design my zone .
You can choose one type to make it as your background , and then find a music player and put your favorite songs into it , so your visitors can enjoy the music after entering into your zone .
Now everything is OK . I can write my blog , right ?
Certainly .
( Half an hour , Janice begins shouting excitedly . ) What's the matter with you ?
Does everybody need to be there ? Hilary and Jason are on vacation this week .
It would be best if everybody could be there . How about next week sometime ?
For the past 5 years , I have been in an Ericsson ( China ) Communication Co , Ltd .
What's your title in the company ?
Yeah , what ’ s up ?
Next Monday is my birthday , and I would like you to attend my party .
Wow . I'd love to .
Great !
When and where ?
Five o ’ clock that afternoon , and in my place , you know ?
Yes , I know . I appreciate your invitation .
I am going to invite other guys . See you that day .
Today is December twenty-third , two thousand and two .
Oh , The day after tomorrow is Christmas .
Not every day , but occasionally .
It will make you as fit as a fiddle .
What can you expect ? Not that good .
What are you going to do then ?
Just let it go .
How are your work now ?
No , thank you . I don't need any . You see , I'm on a diet .
oh , well , perhaps you'd like a cup of coffee or tea instead .
I think this is it . Get off .
Dude , where are we at ?
I have no idea .
I thought this was the right stop .
It doesn't look right to me .
Did you make us get off early ?
I think we did .
I should not have listened to you .
I really thought this was our stop .
Now we have to walk .
No . you ’ re going the wrong way . You wanna 103 from the Beijing zoo .
how can I get it , please ?
You get off at the next stop , cross the street and you will find the stop not far on the right hand side .
could I have a transfer , please ?
Here you are .
Uh , I don't know what to say . What do you want to know ?
What's your method of learning ?
Let me think a minute . I think I always try to take every chance to practice .
What if there is no chance ? I mean what if you don't have a partner , what will you do ?
Well , I talk to myself . That is , I play one role first , then the other .
Oh , I ’ m going to meet my girlfriend in Thailand .
You have a girlfriend in Thailand ? Interesting . How come I have never heard of that ?
Actually it will be my first time to meet her .
You mean you haven ’ t seen her before ? Then , how could she be your girlfriend ? Maybe you don ’ t even know her .
That ’ s true . But we have known each other over the Internet for a few months now . Actually we are on an intimate level . We even plan to be engaged next month .
Congratulations ! It ’ s good to follow your heart . But I just didn ’ t expect to be so fast .
The Internet is making interaction much faster . People are getting to know each other much more quickly this way .
I'd like to be waken up tomorrow morning .
OK sir . At what time ?
Well , how long is it from here to the train station ?
If you take a taxi , it will be 20 minutes .
Well , let me see . Now it's 11:00 sharp . It's a long way to go.If I take the shortest route , we may come across a traffic jam.If I take a less heavy route , it will save us 10 or more minutes , but you'll have to pay more . Which do you prefer ?
Are you sure that I can get there in time if we take the less heavy route ?
Generally speaking , we can if we go at this speed and nothing unexpected happens .
How much more do I have to pay ?
Compared to the shortest route , you may pay around 5 Euro more .
That's acceptable . No one wants to miss a train .
OK ... Here we are . We'll turn left at this cross . To go straight ahead is the shortest route .
Thank you.What ' s the fare ?
$ 10 .
How can it be ?
Well , the rate is two dollars for the first two kilometers and twenty cents for each additional two hundred meters .
What ? Again ? Why do you keep running out of money ?
I guess I don't earn enough .
No , I think it's how you budget your life , that's the problem .
That's my business , not yours .
True enough , until the time comes that you need to take my money . I don't know where you're wasting your money but I think you need to take a look at what's really important .
So how do you survive from pay day to pay day ?
I don't just survive . I put money away as well . I know when I get paid where most of the cash will go , and I stick to my plan . If I follow a budget I don't have any nasty surprises .
I'm not disciplined enough I guess .
I never thought about that , but you're right . What do you think we should do ?
For starters , we should start doing more outdoor activities . That way we'll get some exercise .
I was thinking about taking tennis lessons . I always have an hour to spare in the afternoon . What do you think about that ?
That's not a bad idea . How much is it ?
I heard it is only about one hundred twenty dollars a month for 8 lessons .
My name is Wang Lin . My English name is Linda .
A nice name , isn't it ?
Yeah , like it very much . My name has become a part of me .
Where do you live ?
I live in the Haitian District .
Oh , It's really far from here . May I ask how old you are ?
Yes , I ’ m 38 years old .
You look very young .
Thanks .
Where is your birthplace ?
Thank you . Yes , I would .
These are chocolate , and those are almond-flavored .
I guess I'll try a chocolate one first.Mmmm ... this is delicious.Are they hard to make ?
No , they're really quite easy . Wait a minute , I've got the recipe right here.See ... these are the ingredients , and then you just follow the directions .
Pretty good . How's your business going , Kevin ?
Will you be here long ?
Only three days on business so I won't have a long time .
There are many tourist attractions in Hong Kong .
Do you have some information on these ?
Oh , that's all right . I just wondered what was keeping you .
The bus I took .
What do you mean ?
I took the wrong bus .
Yes , I'm back ! It's nice to see you again . I'm here about those documents .
Ah yes , the ones from Sapporo we were dealing with yesterday ?
That's right . I had a phone call asking me to come back in , about rejecting them ?
Well , we were contacted by your manager and he said ...
Yes , we talked about it and thought it was better and significantly quicker to ask the company to pay a Discrepancy Fee .
The customer got back to us this morning and they have agreed to pay a Discrepancy Fee of 100 US dollars .
Yes . We've got plenty of tables in stock . Will you have a look at this one ?
It's a nice color , and the style is not bad , but a bit too small . I'd like to get a slightly larger one .
How about this one ?
Mmm , I like it . How much is it ?
Seventy US dollars .
Here is the money . Could you deliver this to my house ?
Of course . We are always at your service .
Here is my name card . Thanks .
I need to copy some pages in my book .
The copier is right over there , in the corner .
Do I need to pay to use it ?
You have to pay to use the copier .
How much do you charge ?
You need to pay ten cents for every copy .
Is there a maximum number of copies I can make ?
You can make as many copies as you want .
I ’ m going to need you to show me how to use the machine .
There are instructions posted on the copier .
Believe me , you really look much better than before .
The paper editorials always stick to the quick .
Don't you think it's a bit conservative ?
Yes , where can I buy trousers ?
Follow me , please . How do you like this one ?
What mark is it ?
It ’ s getting worse . Now he ’ s eating me out of house and home . I ’ Ve tried talking to him but it all goes in one ear and out the other . He makes himself at home , which is fine . But what really gets me is that yesterday he walked into the living room in the raw and I had company over ! That was the last straw .
leo , I really think you ’ re beating around the bush with this guy . I know he used to be your best friend in college , but I really think it ’ s time to lay down the law .
Let's see . If we have it , it should be over there under M . ( He looks through the Cds . ) Hmm , it looks like we've sold out of that one , but we should be getting some more copies in soon . If you want , we can order it for you .
That's okay , I'll just check back later . Do you have the new Sting album ?
Yes , it's right over here .
Great . One last question . Where is your jazz section ?
Back there against that wall .
Oh , I see it . Thanks for your help .
What size pan were you thinking of ?
I've already got a small pan . I need a big one .
Well , this one might work for you .
Oh , no , that's way too heavy a pan for me .
Here , lift this aluminum pan . It's the same size .
Yes , it's very lightweight . But I don't want this aluminum handle .
Here's a similar aluminum pan . But it has a heat-resistant handle .
Oh , this feels very nice . It's perfect . I'll take it .
I knew we'd find the right pan sooner or later . How would you like to pay ?
Cash . But first , I need a lid for this pan .
I know . There are too many cars on the roads these days .
I agree . It makes it difficult to breathe .
Yes , I would like to place an order for toner cartridges . We have a standing agreement with you company , so we will need the same amount as last time .
Let me key in your information into my computer . I will pull up our records for you . Do you have an order number ? What name is the order listed under ?
It should be under Leslie Smith . The number is 184796 A .
Yes , Mr . Smith . I have an order for three cases of cartridges , it that what you would like to refill ?
Yes .
Is there the correct billing address ?
No , PLS post the bill to 124 Hildrod Lane , Milton County , 98830 .
I will send you an invoice in the next few days . Your order should be delivered before the end of the day on Monday .
There certainly are a lot . Can you choose a favorite ?
Vanilla with toppings is my favorite .
Is there anything as good as a hot fudge sundae ?
No way ! Do you have a flavors you don't like ?
I don't like ice cream with too many different flavors in it .
I agree with that , it just doesn't work for me .
I saw garlic ice cream on the menu once .
I think that would be horrible !
You ’ re welcome . For the moment , I have no further questions . I got a good picture of the job and the company . All my questions have been answered . Thank you for your time .
We will have an internal discussion and then we will contact to inform you of our decision on whether we continue with you or not .
Ok , it was very nice to talk with you and I look forward to your decision at your earliest convenience . Bye .
Well , it's not the supermarket you want .
I have just changed my plan .
OK .
Yes.Oh , it's you , Linda . I haven't seen you for a long time.Well , come in and sit down.How about something to drink ?
Yes , please . I'm a little thirsty , actually .
Would you like tea or coffee ?
Coffee , please .
Here you are .
Would you like to talk over a drink ?
That sounds good . How are you doing , Linda ?
Just fine.Are you busy now ?
No . I'm just killing time .
Shall we visit our math teacher tomorrow ?
Yes . I haven't been in his house for several weeks.When shall we start ?
How about eight o'clock tomorrow morning ?
They arrested me without probable cause .
They did ?
They had no reason for arresting me .
I thought they let you go .
Yes , the next morning .
They made you spend the night at the station ?
Yes , they did .
What was their reason for arresting you ?
I matched the description of a bank robber they were looking for .
I see .
Yes , Mr . Li . Everyone has been informed .
Great , we don't expect any big problems to happen .
Pleased to meet you , Mr . Farley .
Please have a seat . I know our employment officer has already given you information about your employee contract , but I'd like to go over the main details again before signing . First , you'llbe getting a monthly salary , with one month paid vacation after one year of employment .
OK May I ask whether there is probation ?
Rock'n'Roll , I guess .
You mean the kind of stuff like Nirvana ?
If I think of famous people , I think of Abraham Lincoln .
He's the US president , who walked five miles just to give a lady her change , isn't he ?
That's the one . He also was famous for never giving up on his goals .
That's right . He ran for office quite a few times before he was finally elected .
And I also admire him for his courage in fighting for equal rights .
He had great vision , didn't he ?
It was okay .
Would you like a drink ?
No thanks , I'm not thirsty .
Dinner will be ready at six . Are you hungry ?
Not really .
Oh . Did you pick up the suits from the cleaners ?
Yes I did .
Good . Are you going to the pub tonight ?
Yes please . I really am an absolute amateur when it comes to this stuff .
No problem . First of all , we can provide a business licence . Secondly , Enterprise ID Certificates , Forex registration and ...
Forex registration ?
Just tell the truth . I won ’ t take it personally .
Well ... hum . You are sure you won ’ t lose control of yourself ?
Sometimes it's wise to be direct with people . Come on , just tell me . Don't beat around the bush , please !
Well . Since you ’ d like an honest answer , I will tell you the truth .
Alright . What is that you want to tell me ?
We ’ Ve won two free tickets to Hawaii for a seven-day vacation !
But , Bob , we were so good together .
I'm sorry but it's for the best .
Hello , this is Mr . Morris Pitt . I'd like to speak to Mr . Bell , please .
Just a moment . I am sorry . At the moment , he is out of the office . Would you like to leave your number ? When he comes back , I will tell him to call you back .
Please have him call me at my office . He knows the number .
Since it's your first time to Vienna , I think you should go to the concert .
Good idea . My wife has a fine ear for music . I am sure she would like it .
I would like to rent a car with a good stereo .
All our cars have stereos in them.Stereos , air conditioning . It's all standard with us .
Good . I am here visiting my girlfriend . I want her to have a good time .
Oh , is that so ? Well , then . Let me show you something she might like . It's on our back lot .
This is a Porsche !
Yes . Beautiful , isn't it ?
But I probably can't afford it . It must be really expensive .
Well , sir . You said you were looking at cars at the rental agency at the airport.Now with them you'd spend your money and get nothing for it.But you could probably rent this Porsche from us , for the same price as one of their standard cars .
But how can you do that ?
It's because our prices are so good.And this car has a lot of miles on it . But it's in nice shape , isn't it ?
It's just some turbulence .
I'm scared .
Yes . Should we go there by bus so we aren't late ?
Actually , why don't we go there by bike ? We could get stuck in traffic if we travel by bus in rush hour .
That's true . Cycling is good for our environment , too . Let me just get my helmet then .
Is your helmet comfortable ?
Not really , but I liked the design , so I got it .
Maybe you should think about getting a round helmet ; they're better .
I'll think about it .
Is that your new bicycle ?
Yes , my father gave it to me for my birthday . Do you like it ?
It's the newest 10 speed cycling mountain bike . These are really expensive !
Nothing but the best from my dad . I like everything about it except for the brakes . They are a bit sticky .
I can fix those for you . Is there anything else wrong with it ?
Well , my saddle is too low for me . Do you know how to change the height ?
That's easy . It's important to have the saddle high enough so that your legs can extend fully when you are on your bicycle .
Is that why my knees have felt sore after every time I've ridden my bike ?
I'm fine . I'm just so touched by the sad story .
So I can say now that you must have enjoyed the opera . Which scene is your favorite ?
I love them all . But if I had to name one as the best , I would say it's the ending .
What's it about ? You know , I couldn't help falling asleep .
Did you ? I didn't notice that . But still you should know it , for you have seen it with Laura before .
I guess I've done the same thing last time I was here with her , too . I mean falling asleep . For me , this one is not that attractive .
Then I doubt if you like operas at all .
Yes . I like Carmen very much . But I don't mind if you want to tell me about this one .
OK , then . The man was old and he was visiting his wife's grave , with a rose in his hand . When he got there , he saw someone already put a rose on her grave .
Very impressive . And I do like the leading actress who has an amazing voice .
Me , too . There was always a good round of applause every time she sings .
Yes , the applause ! That was what kept waking me up during the show .
And it's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting , and music . Just amazing !
No doubt , it's not a simple thing to put on a ' phantom show ' .
Is it kept in hand now ?
You might send it as printed matter .
I wonder if you could have ensured here .
Of course . How much would you want to ensure this books for ?
Let me see . I think I can have the ensured five hundred dollars .
five hundred dollars , so you ’ ll pay ten dollars for the insurance . That ’ s two percent of the total value of the article .
hey , Isabelle ...
Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true .
yes , I am the guy ...
what a bummer ! You set me up ?
A cup of coffee , please .
Would you like cream or sugar in your coffee ?
I'd like a little sugar , please .
Sorry , I don't have any sugar .
Why did you ask me if I wanted some ?
Right , here it is .
Thanks . OK ... your balance is 320,214 RIB . How much do you require today ?
I'll take 4,500 RIB , please .
Please fill in this transfer form and enter your password , here . Then the transaction should be completed .
I think it's running late .
It should've been here 30 minutes ago .
It should be coming soon .
It better , because I'm already late for work .
I can't stand riding the bus .
Me too , it's so unreliable .
That is true .
It's also horrible having to be at a bus stop in any kind of weather .
Exactly.That ' s the worst part .
I think it's time we started driving .
Yes . What size are you ?
I am a size 6 .
Try this on please .
This is just my size . How much is the rent
You mean Lily ’ s boyfriend ?
Yeah .
I wish to have a job in which I can make good use of my strengths and have further improvement . And your company meets all my requirements .
Have you got a clear idea about our company ?
Yes , I have purposefully done some homework in advance .
Have you tried other companies ?
Actually , I have applied to several companies recently . But I am most satisfied with your company .
Will you take a job which is not in line with your major ?
Admittedly , I hope it is a job in line with my specialty . But I will make the best effort to do the job whatever is assigned to me .
How long would you work here if you were admitted ?
I would continue to work in the company as long as the job suits me well .
Do you expect a high salary ?
Did you call for a car service
Yes , are you engaged
Not at the moment . Where would you like me to take you
I am going to the airport , and I have to catch the 930 flight to New York .
Well , it's a long way and there is roadwork near Broadway . I am not sure I can snake it in half an hour .
But I can't miss the flight . It's an important meeting and it ’ s waiting for me .
All right , I will try my best . If there aren ’ t any holdups , I think we can get there in time .
That's great . How much is it to the airport
About $ 25 , tips not included .
Fine . Will you please help me with the luggage
Oh , yes , sure . Let me put it in the boot .
Thanks very much .
Not at all . Bang the door , please .
Ok , let's hurry .
It's Monday , October 27 . Speaking of dates , when are you leaving ?
I'm leaving on November 10th .
Isn't it a Sunday ?
No , it's a Monday .
So you are leaving two weeks from now ?
Four ports .
The ship is going very fast .
Perhaps she makes about 25 knots an hour .
You look pale . Are you seasick ?
I don't feel very good .
I have some tablets for seasickness .
They give me no help at all .
She must be a good wife .
Not necessarily . This is only what she says , not what she does .
Yes . But he is meeting a client .
Oh , that's too bad . I just got a phone call saying that my wife is now in the hospital . She is going to deliver a baby . I must take the day off to go to the hospital . May I talk to him to ask for leave ?
I am afraid not , but I think I could convey your leave to him after the client goes .
Yes , I have found three companies .
Have you called to inquire about the positions ?
Yes , but the results are not so satisfying .
What's the matter ?
I asked the first company about the vacancy , but they had already hired someone .
What a pity !
The second one told me that the job information was released half a year ago , and had been overdue .
It's frustrating !
The last company is still hiring , but not recent graduates .
Wonder why they do that !
I feel terrible now .
Don't be discouraged . Just keep trying and you will find a job eventually .
Did it spill on your clothes ?
No , but the table cloth was dirty .
That's OK .
I'm afraid it's too hard to wash off the stain .
It's no big deal .
I really feel great shame . Let me buy a new one for you .
Sure , I advise the sightseeing buses .
Travel by the buses ? That sounds interesting .
Yes of course.You can see the whole city on the bus . It's cheap as well as efficient .
I ’ m not sure , but probably about 75 years . How about in your country ?
About 70 , I think . This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . It ’ s a problem that will soon affect most of the world .
I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly .
Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday .
Did she ? That ’ s great . However , if we have too many children , that will have a bad effect on the enviroment .
How ’ s your son these days ?
Oh , he ’ s fine . Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays .
He ’ ll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you mine it is a good age to have a child ?
I had mine when I was 24 . that ’ s a little young . I ’ d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career .
Yes , I think you ’ re right . I ’ m thinking about having a child , but not just yet .
Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country ?
Yes , there is . Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . They want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . They want to develop their own view of life . Parents usually try to discourage them , but they don ’ t often succeed .
Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . Sometimes they give them too much freedom .
Yes , it's very nice . All our foreign visitors enjoy it . The food is wonderfully well-prepared . Let me know if you need any help with the menu .
Thank you . Mmm . Can you tell me about the terrine ?
Yes . A terrine is a kind of meat pate . It's meat turned into a paste . It sounds horrible but it's actually really good .
Mmm . Maybe another time .
You could try the ravioli . They are rather like your Chinese dumplings , and the sauce is delicious .
Sounds good . I think I'll have the lamb for my main course . What does it come with ?
Well , you can have fries-French fries-or simple boiled potatoes .
I'll have the potatoes . What are you having ?
I'm having my usual . I like the fish here . Would you like some wine ?
Yes , I joined your group of bus tour this morning . You promised the journey will last 3 hours and we will visit 15 sightseeing spots .
Yes , sir . We promised that .
But have 2 - hour journey .
I hope to apply my knowledge and experience on the job and make further improvement .
What do you think about occupational planning ?
It is quite important for all of us . Without clear goals , one may lose direction and cannot pave the way for their future .
Tell me something about your goals .
As a graduate , it may be more important to develop myself effectively in my future work . And whatever job I may take , I will make the best efforts .
If confronted with difficult task , what will you do ?
I will make full use of the chance and get myself ready for the challenges all the time .
Would you care much about your salary ?
Salary is , admittedly , important , but I will care more about what I can learn from the job .
If you were assigned some work which you are not so interested , would you take it or not ?
Checking out time is twelve . Guests will avoid an additional days room charge by checking out on time .
It's nearly 12:00 now . Will I be charged extra ?
We won't charge any extra if you'd vacate the room by two o'clock .
Thank you very much . May I leave my baggage here until Thursday ?
Yes . We can put it in our storage room .
Will there be any extra charge ?
There will be no charge on baggage left by guests who have checked out .
I'll have us ready for Stars.com by the end of next week . After that , I don't know .
Don't know what ?
Let's just say there could be some big changes around here .
Is that right ? Like what kind of changes ?
You'll see . Oh , yeah , you'll see .
The system of public schools is fairly uniform everywhere throughout the United States .
Do most students in the United States attend private schools or public schools ?
Most public schools in the United States are very good , and the majority of students attend the public schools .
Which students go to private schools , then ?
Children needing special instruction . Children whose parents can afford to send them to private schools , and children whose parents want them to receive a religious education .
But are the public schools good everywhere ?
No , public schools can be very different . Even in the same city .
Dose it cost anything to attend the public schools ? Are there any restrictions as to who may and may not attend ?
l am afraid there isn't any fancy soap in my room .
Sorry sir , we will bring you one.Anything else ?
Zina ? Zina the Snake ?
I got your e-mail a couple of months back .
Yeah ? Which one was that ?
The one that said , You're a creep . From me you won't hear another peep . I hope you wreck your jeep .
Yes . I bought the can two days ago , but today I found that is beyond the guarantee period .
Now what are you doing ?
Putting on mascara .
Nasty . You'd better not rub your eyes .
I won't .
I have a really bad toothache ! My cheek is swollen and I can ’ t eat anything .
Let ’ s have a look . Mmmm . This doesn ’ t look too good . I think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth . It ’ s pressing against your molars and that ’ s one of the reasons you are experiencing so much pain
When you pull my tooth will you also have to extract the nerve and the root ?
First we will take some x-rays and see what we ’ re dealing with . I also noticed a small cavity up front here , so you are going to need a filling .
I guess that ’ s what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth three times a day .
Yes , and I know a few things I'd spend the money on .
Yeah , me too .
Rocky six is suppose to come out this Friday .
Yeah , but I don't know if it is going to be any good .
The only reason I want to see it is because I have seen the previous five .
True . Ok . Let's see it this Saturday .
How about we hook up for lunch at 12:00 , and then go see the movie afterwards .
No ! My tour bus got a speeding ticket not ten minutes ago . Now my engine is on fire !
I think that's just steam . Your engine's overheated .
Do you know a lot about cars ?
A little bit . I'll take a look if you want me to .
Please . Thank you so much for stopping .
Yeah , she's hot . Radiator's leaking . Looks like you were running her pretty hard .
That must have been just before I got the speeding ticket .
Did you have an accident recently ... Hey , wait a second ! I know this car !
You do ?
I ran into it a couple of weeks ago . What do you know ? Name's Hal .
I'm Akimbo . Nice to meet you , I guess .
Boy , I'm sure sorry about your car . Hey , Akimbo , I wonder if you'd like to make a deal ?
What kind of deal ?
I'd like to give you cash for the damage to your car .
You don't want your insurance company to pay for it ?
I'd rather not . They'll raise my rates . It'll cost me more in the long run .
If you give me cash , do you care if I don't fix the car ?
Hell , I don't care . Just don'T submit a report to your insurancecompany .
Hi , Mary . Lily wanted me to buy her some things for the party .
What do you think of the traffic today ?
It ’ s pretty bad .
Yeah . You can say that again . It ’ s noisy too .
Yes , it is . What about it ?
I backed into it while I was trying to get into the parking lot .
I see .
I'm really sorry . I'll face the music .
Where did you hit it ?
Right here . See the scratch ?
What do you have ?
I have apple pie , ice cream , chocolate cake and fruit cocktail .
Can I have apple pie with ice cream ?
Of course . I made the apple pie this morning , so it ’ s lovely and fresh .
I love your home-made apple pie.It ’ s delicious.Can I have another glass of lemonade as well ?
Sure.Can you get it yourself , it ’ s in the refrigerator .
Ok.Would you like a drink too ?
Yes , I ’ ll have an ice tea.You see it next to the lemonade .
Are you having any dessert ?
Yes , here is our offer , 30,000 skirts at 200 yuan per skirt , FOB New York . You will find our price comes in line with the prevailing market .
Your price is rather high . We cannot accept it . Can you bring the price down a little ?
In fact , if it weren't for our good relations , we wouldn't consider making you a firm order at this price .
I can't agree with you . We have quotation from other sources too . Their prices are lower than yours .
But you know our design is superior to any other products from other companies . In fact , there is no room to negotiate the price now . You should be aware that the production cost alone has doubled in the past year .
I ’ m great . Thanks .
What do you need ?
I need to know if I have any fees to pay .
Actually , you do owe some fees .
How much do I owe ?
Your fees total $ 235.13 .
That ’ s crazy !
You need to pay these fees soon .
Can I do that right now ?
Will you be paying with cash or check ?
Oh , hey , no kidding ! I haven't seen you since orientation three months ago ! So how've you been ? Settling into college life OK ?
Yeah , I think so ! I pledged Phi Iota Alpha , so I'm living at the frat house now .
Oh , so you're a frat boy now , huh ?
Yeah , yeah , I know , it's totally cliche , but really , I think it's been a good decision . I've got a lot of support and good suggestions from the guys . What about you ? What have you been up to ?
Not much . I'm still living at home and commuting to school . I ended up dropping that metalworking class I was so excited about . It just wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped . The guidance counselor suggested that I focus on my prerequisite courses so that I can make sure the credits count .
That sounds smart ... but kind of boring .
Yeah , it is , a little bit . I joined the Great Outdoors Club , though , which has been a lot of fun . We've gone on two camping trips already , and I've made some good friends .
That's cool . Hey , so have you decided on your major yet ?
Definitely pre-med . What about you ?
I still have no clue ... but we don't have to declare a major till our sophomore year , so I've got time ! Oops , I'm late for class . Gotta run !
OK , take care ! Hey , nice running into you !
I'd like to taste Mexican food .
How about the one on Baker Street ?
I'm sorry I can't bring better news , sir . The site is a disaster .
That's what I was afraid of .
It is not only the earthquake , sir . But the mudslides.Much of the north half of the site has been covered over by mud .
Mud ? But Ivan told me there were no mudslides in that district . I thought all the mudslides were down in Chichitango .
That's what we thought , sir . That's what the news reported.But there was one little mudslide in our district too . Right above our site .
Oh , that's terrible ! What bad luck ! I wish we had never come to this country.But , if it isn't the strikes and the revolutionaries , it's the earthquakes.Our operations here are finished !
I'm sorry , sir .
It's not your fault , Yuri.But tell me . When will Ivan be able to get out there ?
Well , it took me about nine hours to get back here by car.If Ivan leaves tonight , I think he should be there by tomorrow lunch .
Good . I want an estimate of damages as soon as possible .
But sir ...
Yes , Yuri ?
I wouldn't recommend sending Ivan now.Especially not at night . The roads aren't safe .
Has the earthquake damaged the bridges too ?
No , sir . The bridges are fine.But I've heard rumors that the revolutionaries are coming down from the mountains.There has been fighting , sir .
Are you serious ? Fighting ? But I didn't hear anything on the news .
You know the government controls the press here , sir . They don't want it reported .
Oh , this is terrible , Yuri . Terrible ! So we can't even assess the damages . How can we do business in this country ? Either we're buried under mud , or we're in danger of getting kidnapped.No , I can't believe this mess !
I'm sorry , sir .
No , nothing . Why ?
Do you like western music ?
Yes , I do , very much .
There ’ s a concert tonight . Would you like to go and listen to it ?
Yes , I would like to book a table for six for the next Monday .
Certainly , sir . At what time should we expect you ?
At 6:30 on next Monday evening .
And what is it going to be , Chinese food or Western food ?
Chinese food .
May I have your name , sir , please ?
Please book it under the name of Mr . Peter .
So it's Mr . Peter , a table for six for the evening of the next Monday . It is Chinese food and you are coming at 6:30 .
That's right .
Yes , I'm looking for Bob .
He's in a meeting with Phil .
Yes , can you tell me how to use the phone in my room ?
Certainly . If you want to make a local call , dial 10 first and then call the number you want .
Ok . I ’ m really bored at the moment .
Ok . This man is tall and slim . He ’ s got blue eyes and curly brown hair .
Does he have a moustache or a beard ?
Good question . Yes , he has a moustache , but no beard .
Sounds like Mike , is it ?
Yes , it is . You describe someone we both know .
Right . She ’ s not very tall and she ’ s quite plump . She ’ s got blonder hair , but I don ’ t know what color her eyes are .
Is she attractive ? I don ’ t think I know anyone like that .
Well , I don't find her attractive , but I'm sure you will disagree .
I like slim girls , so I doubt I would find a plump girl attractive . You ’ ll have to give me some more information .
She ’ s got tiny feet and wears really unfashionable shoes . In fact , she wears unfashionable clothes too .
This doesn ’ t sound like anyone I know . I give up . Teel me who she is .
She ’ s your mother !
How embarrassing ! I don ’ t even recognize a description of my own mother ! How important do you think appearance is ?
I think that unfortunately it ’ s more important than a person ’ s character . Advertising and stuff tells us that we have to be attractive . I think it ’ s wrong , but that ’ s the way the world is now .
I ’ m afraid you ’ re right . I chose my girlfriend because she has a wonderful personality .
You can have a bird view of Guiling City from the top of the mountain .
Wonderful ! I'll often come here for mountain climbing .
You should . Many Guiliners , especially the old and the young , will climb mountains here in the morning .
No wonder people say
Quick ! Pass me your binoculars . Look at that bird ... I've never seen one of those before . It's indigenous to Guiling , and an endangered species too . This is lucky !
I didn't know you liked bird-watching .
It ’ s a programme about islam . It ’ s very interesting .
Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ?
They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage haj .
Why do they go there ?
Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith .
When muslims pray , they face towards mecca .
That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed .
I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone .
That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents .
Pilgrimages are common in many faiths .
Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages .
Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ?
I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there .
Do you think that there is something magical about that place ?
He's cute ! He looks like Tiger Woods ! But , I can't dance ...
It's all good . I'll show you all the right moves . My name's Malik .
Nice to meet you . I'm Wen , and this is Nikki .
How you feeling ’ , vista ? Mind if I take your friend ' round the dance floor ?
She doesn't mind if you don't mind getting your feet stepped on .
What ’ s that ?
I ’ m sorry , sir . Smoking is not permitted in this area .
Yes , I need this prescription please .
Let ’ s see . Okay , so 50 mg of Prozac , would you prefer this in capsule or tablet ?
Capsules are fine .
Okay , you should take 1 capsule 3 times a day . Be sure not to take it on an empty stomach , and also , don ’ t ever mix it with alcohol !
Yes , I know . It ’ s not the first time I ’ m taking this ! Don ’ t worry , I won ’ t overdose !
Okay , anything else I can get you ?
Oh , yes , I almost forgot ! Can I also get some eye drops and um , some condoms ?
Sure . Darn condoms aren ’ t registered in our system .
Oh , well that ’ s okay , I ’ ll get some later , thanks ... Really it ’ s no problem .
Hello , yes , can I do Bank-Insurance Link business here ?
Yes , you can . The best way is to first select the company you want to buy from , then we can help you to do it . Do you have a Current Account here ?
Yes . Is that necessary ?
Well , it certainly makes everything easier , both at this end and at your end .
Yes , we are travelling at rush hours . It could be very crowded in the morning and after 6 o'clock in the afternoon .
I hear many people have cars .
Yes , almost all the families have their own cars .
Why don't they drive ? Isn't a car more convenient than the subway ?
Well , it is hard to find a parking place in the city . Besides , parking is quite expensive in the downtown .
Not bad . Thank you for your help . I am always busy with this job , I feel a bit tired .
I had the same feeling when I first came to work here . but after a period of time , I feel better , I am sure you ' ll get used to this busy job .
I also feel that work efficiency here is very high . and you have strong working ability and professional skill , it seems that you know all , that's really wonderful !
You know the phrase the survival of the fittest . We have no choices .
Just so-so.You ' re doing all right ?
Same old thing.What about a drink ?
That's all for now . How much do I owe you ?
That'll be fifty-five dollars and twenty cents .
Can't you make it a little cheaper ?
Oh , no , sir . We already gave you a discount on each item .
Really ? He deserves it ! They should teach him a good lesson .
But the word is his brother would go bail for him . Last time it ’ s his father who went bail for him .
Yes . I am Thou Ping .
How do you spell you first name ?
Ping . P-I-N-G .
Do you have an English name ?
Yes , sir . It is Jane . It was given by my English professor when I was at the university .
What ’ s your pen name ?
My pen name is ' Dark Blue ' .
How do you like your name ?
I like it very much . My name has became part of me . I don ’ t want to change it .
What ’ s your present ( permanent ) address ?
My present address is No . 21 South Zhongshan Road , Apt . 19 , Shanghai . The post code is 220150 .
You look very young . How old are you ?
Actually , I ’ m thirty now .
Where were you born ?
I was born in Xinjiang .
What is your nationality ?
Ow ! Don ’ t shout so loud . Calm down . Please stop shouting and sit quietly down .
I found a mouse in our house , a grown mouse running around the dinning room .
Where is it now ?
It ’ s under the couch .
Now , move the couch around and turn it upside down .
Ok , I don ’ t want a mouse in our house . We have the tidiest house in the town .
Not at all . What would you like to see first ?
I really don't know .
Let's walk around the lake first , shall we ?
Yes , that would be lovely .
Have you been here before ?
No , it's the first time I've been here .
I will take you to Li River after walking around here .
That's wonderful ! I have heard the scene of Li River is beautiful !
Now . you can see why it's called the Lantern Festival .
Yes , it deserves its name .
Did you notice the characters on the lanterns ?
Sure . But you know that I can't read any Chinese characters . What do they say ?
They are puzzles . It's a tradition to solve the puzzles on the lanterns during the Lantern Festival .
We've got several good chicken dishes if you like chicken .
We'll try one of your specials this time .
Nothing important . I've been working overtime lately .
How many hours do you work each day now ?
12 hours , including 5 hours overtime .
That's tough indeed ! Do you think your health can afford ?
I don't care . I need money .
Surely you'll be paid extra for overtime , but do you think it's really worth ?
Yes , I think so . When I work overtime I'm paid time and a half .
Oh , yes . Money comes faster in that way than otherwise .
But jobs with a lot of overtime are quite limited . Employers usually don't like to pay for overtime if they can manage .
No , I haven't . What about you ?
I got a ticket a couple of days ago .
What did you do ?
I got it for parking in the red zone .
Why would you park in the red zone ?
I had to run in and get something quickly .
Where were you at ?
I got the ticket in front of my apartment .
I thought that you had your own parking spot ?
I had to make it quick .
Huh , oh , hi , Jane . I must have fallen asleep while I was reading .
You and everyone else . It looks more like a camp-ground than a library .
Well , the dorm ’ s too noisy to study in , and I guess this place is too quiet .
Have you had any luck finding a topic for your paper ?
No . Prof . Grant told us to write about anything in cultural anthropology . For once I wish she hadn ’ t given us so much of a choice .
Well , why not write about the ancient civilizations of Mexico . You seem to be interested in that part of the world .
I am , but there is too much material to cover . I ’ ll be writing forever , and Grant only wants five to seven pages .
So they limit it to one region of Mexico . Say the Yucatan . You ’ Ve been there and you said it ’ s got lots of interesting relics .
Hi , this is Maria . Is that Shirley ?
Hi , Maria , this is Shirley .
Shirley , do you know today's homework from our economic law class ? I have written it on a piece of paper but I can't find it now .
Hold on for a moment please . I'm fetching my textbook .
OK .
Oh , the homework is to explain what economic law is both in broad sense and in narrow sense .
Explain the economic law ? An essay question again ?
Yes . You can use your textbook for your reference .
Are there any clear answers in the book to this question ?
I don't think so , Maria , but I think you can look for information on the Internet .
OK , thank you , Shirley . You are very helpful . I have another question . When does the Economic Law of China come into effect ?
Oh , there isn't such a code called economic law . The Economic Law of China is a general concept for several laws .
There isn't such a code ?
Yes , it's a general name for several laws related to economics , like Commercial Law , and Law of Central Bank .
Seven dollars ! ! ! Incredible ! But I saw that the seller has kind of a bad rating .
Was it a delivery problem or a problem with the products ?
I read that someone called him a cheat and a liar ! And I noticed that he won't ship abroad .
Some people get nasty on those comments . Maybe you should write him and ask nicely .
Yes . Actually our range of sweaters is the most comprehensive available .
Can I try this one on ?
Sure , go ahead .
I'm sorry to hear that . Please tell me the exact problem .
This room is overrun with cockroaches .
There has been an occasional silverfish in the hotel , sir .
I stopped counting at nine .
Sir , this hotel just passed a thorough insect inspection with flying colors .
Your inspector needs spectacles . The fact is that cockroaches are running rampant .
Hello . I need to find out if a Receipt of Proceeds has arrived . I'm from Felix Wasserman Associates .
Thanks . Have you got the L / C number ?
It's NX567822100007 .
Hang on a tick and I'll check for you . I'm sorry ; we have no record of that arriving .
OK , thanks for checking . Could you give me a ring when it arrives , please ?
Sure , turn left at the next crossing .
Is it on Xinhua street ?
Great , the lamb stew tastes incredible .
I like it , too . I like the fish especially . It's so fresh , and the flavoury is kind of like for a fresh water fish .
Yes , the food here deserves its reputation . Chinese food is one of my favorites 。
If you like , I'll take you to a new restaurant next time , I just heard about it from my friend , and he was just raving about it . It's such a great Sichuan cuisine . Would you like to try that ?
Sure , I'd love to . I heard Sichuan cuisine is very hot , I think I definitely love it .
Great , I love hot food too .
Well , let's finish this great dinner first .
Well , since we are getting up so late , I decided to make a big breakfast !
Nice ! Brunch !
Kind of , so I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs , some french toast and buttermilk pancakes !
Wow ! You really went all out ! Did you make any coffee ?
Yeah , just the way you like it ! I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light .
Looks good ! I ’ ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .
Pretty good . Mary , I was wondering if you would like to come to a party on Friday night ?
I am free that night , and a party sounds good .
Fine . It will be at my house . Do you know how to get there ?
I kind of know where you live , but could you e-mail me your address ?
I can do that . Do you have anyone that you would like to bring with you to the party ?
I would really like to bring my friend Jake , if that would be OK .
Oh yeah , I remember Jake . That would be fine .
Would you like some help with the food ?
Good evening . We want a dinning room with a table for eight .
I'm sorry , sir . The rooms are not available now . But would you like to have your dinner in the dinning hall ? I can find a table by the window for you .
No , thanks . We have made a reservation before .
Can I have your name , please ?
My name is James .
I'll ask waitress to show you the way .
If you go to the breakfast aisle , you'll find the cereal there .
What aisle is that ?
You'll find it by the oatmeal and breakfast bars .
I know where that is at .
Is there anything else you need help finding ?
Could you point me toward the dishwashing detergent ?
That's over by the paper towels and toilet paper .
I didn't even think about that .
That's where it is .
Thank you so much for helping me .
I have had enough gin fizz and bloody mary . But I have no idea about Chinese cocktails .
Would you prefer our cocktail — Shanghai cocktail ? It's a mixture of real Chinese ingredients .
That ’ s good .
( The waiter makes the cocktail for Mr . Bellow and hands into him . ) Here is your Shanghai cocktail , Mr . Bellow .
Not much , that new reality-TV show , Ally McNeal , oooo , Dark Angel .
Wait a second . I want to watch Ally McNeal .
Oh , come on . That ’ s such a girl ’ s show .
No it ’ s not . It ’ s just funny .
Yeah , if you ’ re a girl .
Well , you just want to watch Dark Angel because of the hot girl .
That ’ s not true . Dark Angel is a good show .
It ’ s story is just an excuse to get the girl dressed up in different tight outfits .
O . K . , O . K . Let ’ s forget it . There ’ s a football game on too .
I would like to know the state of the residential property market right now because I have an apartment to sell .
Sure , here is my business card . I'm James Wilson . Let me explain to you how things are . In recent months , the demand for residential properties has become extremely high . The price of residential properly has risen almost twenty percent .
Really ? Since I have to go back to England within the next few months , I would like to sell my apartment as soon as possible .
Don't worry , sir . I think it's a seller's market right now . Let me get down some information about your apartment first . what is your property's address ?
Flat C . 15 / F , Tong House , Tai Koo Shing .
What is the square footage of your property ? How many bedrooms and living rooms ?
Its gross area is approximately nine hundred square feet . There's one living room , one dining room , one master bedroom and two other bedrooms .
What is the orientation and view ?
It faces south with a hillside view .
The market price for Tong House is around five thousand Hong Kong dollars per square foot , but it also depends on the internal layout and condition of the house .
I would like to ask for four point five million Hong Kong dollars .
May I have your name and contact number , Sir ?
Johnson , and my contact number is 2876543 2 . My office number is 2123456 7 .
Thank you , Mr . Johnson . May I ask you one more question ? When will your property become available ?
In about one month .
Also , Mr . Johnson , I would like to remind you my company will charge a commission equivalent to one percent of the transaction price in the event of a successful selling of the property through our introduction .
No problem .
Thank you very much . I will introduce your property to our clients . When they want to see your property , I will give you a call .
Yes , of course . It seems made to measure .
Well , I think that one fits me better . What's the price ?
Yeah , I'm very worried about his health .
He looks tired all the time .
What should I wear today ?
It's chilly outside , so don't forget to put on your jacket .
How's the shirt ?
When it comes to that , I have a lot to say .
Then say it .
When I went back to my doctor to hear the results of my lab tests , I tried to keep a poker face even though I was scared to death . Then you guess what he said .
That ’ s just what I want to know .
Why do you say that ?
Because her children have been the age when they seem to quarrel all day long .
Oh , I see . She told me that she had learned very quickly how to pour oil on troubled waters , but not to pour oil on the flame .
This one is . I have another one that's furnished , but I'm not sure you'll like the furniture .
We have tons of furniture . What we need are air conditioners .
This building is only four years old . It was built with central air .
Just like in the States ! That's perfect !
Of course . What would you like ?
I want a bottle of champagne , lobster tail , and filet mignon , medium rare .
I'm so sorry . We ran out of filet mignon . May I suggest the porterhouse instead ?
That's too bad , but the porterhouse will be okay .
May I be so bold as to suggest chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne ?
Not tonight , thank you .
No strawberries . We'll charge your amenities account , if that's okay .
Charge it to whatever account you like .
Sorry to trouble you . But I don't think this fish is fresh . It actually tastes a bit off .
Sorry , Miss . I'll place it immediately , can I get you another drink , or you wait ?
No , please don't do that . I'd just like to return it .
I'm sorry , Miss , but I'm afraid we can't do that . You'll order something else instead . I'd love to suggest the steak , it's the special today , and quite tasty .
Ok , then please bring me the steak mediun-rare , thank you .
Sure . What do you want to have today ?
Cream soup and steak , please .
How do you like your steak ?
Excuse me , what does that mean ?
Well , there are several kinds of steaks . For example , you can have your steaks medium-rare , medium-well or well-done .
Don't worry . I'll drive you back .
Yes , there aren't any clouds in the sky and we've got such a beautiful view here . Look ! This is St James Park . And there's Buckingham Palace
Where's Hyde Park ?
It's on the other side of the Palace .
That's the place where people make speeches on Sundays , isn't it ?
Yes , you're right . Politicians of all kinds , religious people , and one or two madmen .
Well , are we going there today ? I want to take shots there .
Sure . I can see you're enjoying your trip today .
I do a forty-hour week . I ’ m on flexi-time . I usually start work at 8 a . m . and finish at 4
And how many weeks holiday do you get a year ?
Four - plus public holidays . I usually take two weeks off in the summer and the rest at New Year .
Do you do overtime ?
Yes .
If I were in your position , I wouldn't give up an inch .
Why do you say so ?
The trash of the world he sets high price upon , but the heavenly things he shamefully undervalues .
Who was elected ?
McCain won the election .
That can ’ t be true !
I ’ m upset , too .
I can ’ t believe people voted for him .
People must want him as our President .
That doesn ’ t make any sense .
I have more bad news .
How could the news get any worse ?
I was only kidding , because Obama won the election .
not really . Sometimes , I even let other people make key decision for me .
what kinds of decisions do you leave to other people ?
there are basic decisions like which restaurant to go to . I can never seem to choose . I let my parents make big decisions for me . They chose my university and my course . I ended up studying something
your parents will be choosing your girlfriend if you aren ’ t careful ! Why don ’ t you try being more decisive ? Start with some basic ones . When your friends are discussing which restaurant to eat at , mak
that ’ s a good idea . You ’ re very decisive , I ’ Ve noticed . So , which bar are we going to this evening ?
I can ’ t make a decision . You ’ ll have to put forward an idea .
ok , i choose luckies .
OK . But where is my favorite coffee ?
It's in that pan there . Your boy Dean broke the silex yesterday , so I have to boil it in the pan .
It tastes like crankcase oil , but delicious .
That's good . You can make breakfast yourself if you don't like it .
What is there besides coffee ?
I warmed a couple of snails , and your eggs are in the frying pan .
Oh , my God . It's nearly eight , I have no time to have breakfast now . My watch says seven fifty .
Don't worry . It's only ten to seven . You must have forgotten to set your watch back .
Yes , it was . The clock on the wall says eight to seven .
Yeah . Keep on eating your breakfast . You can catch the early bus .
Come in please .
What's the matter , sir ?
The toilet doesn't flush .
Let me see.En .. it's right now.You can try it .
Wonderfull.Thanks a lot .
Nobody told you what happened ?
Tell me the news .
A truck turned over on the freeway .
Are you kidding ?
I am completely serious .
Did anyone get hurt ?
I believe that two people did get hurt .
Were the injuries minor ?
I believe so .
That's great to hear .
I'd enjoy that .
I'll pick you up around 8: 00 .
I'd like to speak to someone in your Accounts Department , please .
Just a moment ... I'm afraid there's nobody there right now . Could I take a message ?
Yes , please . My name's Michael Caxton from one of your customers — Rosedale Investments .
Sorry , just a moment . The name is Caxton ...
No , it's Caxton .
Fine , I've got that . And your company is ...
Rosedale Investments .
Could you spell that , please ?
It's R , O , S , E , D , A , L , E .
Thank you . And the message ?
It's about an invoice which is wrong .
Have you got the number there ?
Um ... yes ... it's 856674 / ros .
856674 .
That's right .
OK , I'll get someone to phone you first thing in the morning .
I didn't like it . Not a bit . I couldn't stand the music . Besides the story was so boring that it put me to sleep .
I noticed that , it was not exciting as I expected , but the music was great . I'm always found Jazz . And that movie had a lot of Jazz .
I know . However , Jazz always annoys me . I really don't enjoy music in a movie .
I'm sorry to hear that.What kind of movie do you like ?
Anything with a lot of action , I like thrillers and chillers .
Oh , I see .
Well , I enjoy the popcorn and being with you.You ' re more important than the movie .
Thanks for the sweet words .
No , the steak was recommended , but it is not very fresh .
Oh , sorry to hear that . This is quite unusual . I will look into the matter .
This is very annoying .
I'm sorry , sir . Do you wish to try something else ? That would be on the house , of course .
No , I don't risk it .
How about a delicious dessert then , with our compliment ?
I'm not keen on dessert as a habit . They are fattening .
Sure . Let me get it for you .
Can you also show me this one ?
No problem . This one is made of pure gold .
I think the cloisonn bracelet is more beautiful .
You ’ re right . This one costs less , but is more beautiful .
Will the luster fade out after some time ?
No , we guarantee the quality .
Ok . Can I try it on ?
Ordinarily , as soon as you are seated , you put your napkin on your lap .
How about at a formal dinner ?
Yes please . Do you have any teas ?
Of course we have lots of teas ?
What do you recommend ?
What about a green tea or perhaps a jasmine tea ?
What ’ s this one ?
That ’ s Oolong tea – it ’ s a Cantonese tea .
Yes , the swimming pool is right behind the building . Walk out of the door and you will see it .
What's the fare ?
$ 10 per hour .
She's gone to a flower shop . Today is her husband's birthday .
Here is the copy . Do you need anything else ?
Yes , I also need all the letters we received from them .
Do you mean all the sales letters from them ?
Yes , that ’ s right .
I ’ ll get them for you at once . And could I file the report for you ?
Yes , but I need the report copied on transparency paper .
Hey , Daddy , today I had really a fantastic history class .
Wow , it's so strange for you to say things like that . What had happened ?
We've learnt the story of Zheg He Sailing to West Ocean . He is a real great navigator .
Did your teacher tell you the route he took ?
Yeah , he , with his fleet , came across the Indian Ocean , and arrived at the east coast of Africa .
Great , do you still remember when he started his voyage ?
Of course , that is from 1405 to 1433 , which is in Ming dynasty .
Good , by the way , do you finish reading the book Robinson Crusoe I've bought for you ?
Not yet , you know I have a lot of homework to do .
You should speed up , because the story of Robinson can give you a better understanding about what you learned today .
OK , great Daddy , after supper , I'll embark on it .
That's my boy ! Wait , Daniel , when is Pirates of the Caribbean on ?
Is it about Captain Jack Sparrow , who wants to find the treasure on the sea ?
Exactly , now , tell me the time .
Two rows up on the right . We have various kinds of chocolates .
Thank you . How much is this kind of chocolate ?
I ’ Ve been away on holidays for sometime .
No wonder I haven ’ t seen you recently . Where did you spend your holidays ?
I went with my husband . Our first stop was Bangkok . We stayed there for 5 days . Then we flew to Hong Kong , stopover for 3 days . Our last stop was China . We visited the Great Wall .
You must have a wonderful time .
Yes . We enjoyed ourselves very much . Have you traveled much , Luke ?
Do you know various funds and accounts ?
Yes , I enjoy working with that .
Oh . You took the wrong bus . You need to take Bus 151 which goes the opposite direction .
Oh , no ! What should I do now ?
Don't worry . You can get off at the next stop and walk across the street and take the Bus 151 to the opposite direction .
Ok . How many stops do I have to go ?
About 15 stops .
That is a long way to go . It is so kind of you to help me . Thank you very much .
Do you know which channel it is on ?
Five I think . All three candidates are presenting their campaign platforms .
I used to be really interested in that . But lately it seems that they end up saying one thing and doing another anyway . So why listen ?
We have to . If nobody listened that would be like turning our backs on our own rights and obligations to the freedoms that our forefathers fought for .
It's not that serious .
Yes it is . Think about it . If nobody paid any attention to anything then what's it all for anyway ?
Over here , Betty !
Hi , Rock Sam ! Hey , I am surprised to see you doing so well .
Haha . Don ’ t worry , Betty . So tell me , what ’ s the latest gossip ? Unless you want to keep it to yourself .
No way . Alisan Darling just got hitched in Vagas .
No kidding ! What happened to Ad ?
Darling found out he was having a fling , and one new girl found out about Darling she dumped him too .
Was , talk about a double whammy .
Ya . And now I can break this to you . Fanny is moving .
Oh , right . What a load off my mind . I really don ’ t like her .
Well I have to go , Rock Sam . You take it easy , OK .
If I ordered a desk today , how would it be before I got delivery in Scotland ?
I was drying my hair and ironing my shirt ! Can you come here for a sec ? I need your help .
What is it ? Why are all these clothes on the bed ?
I don ’ t know what to wear ! Ok , give me your opinion . Do you like the way this looks ? The striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals . I like the cut and hemline of these shorts so I think I ’ ll wear these as well .
Are you joking ? What am I going to do with you ? We are going to a dinner party not the beach ! Wear the shirt with the silk tie I bought you and these corduroy pants . It ’ s chilly outside so you can wear this coat .
Yes . I have to stay in your cry for just one day , can you suggest a short tour ?
Are you interested in the natural landscape or the human landscape ?
I would prefer the first one .
Yes , what sort of warranty comes with this stereo ?
Well , our store offers a 90 - Day return policy and the manufacturer offers a one-year warranty on any factory defects .
What conditions are there on the store policy ?
We ’ ll give you your money back as long as the stereo is returned in the original packaging and with a receipt .
O . K . How do I get the manufacturer ’ s warranty ?
Just send in the warranty card with a copy of your receipt .
All right , those sound good . I ’ ll take it .
Yes , I like ping-pong very much , but I can't play well .
Oh , no ! How did this happen . Are you sure ?
I overheard this information when I passed Arden's office . We got some complaints from consumers yesterday . I am terribly sorry for that .
My God ! I actually checked them one by one . How could this be ?
Calm down ! It is useless to act like that . Can we find some solutions ?
What kind of solution can I have now ? I nearly go crazy now .
But we still have to find one . Can we find Arden to check whether this is true or not ?
It seems that I have nothing to do , except this .
No problem , if possible I always combine business with pleasure . Now , let ’ s hear more about these chocolates you ’ re offering .
Well , as you know , I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States . They ’ re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . Naturally , your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant , luxurious , first class dining .
Mmmm , sounds interesting ... gourmet chocolates , where are they produced ? Belgium ?
Actually , the factory is located in Scotland .
Really ? I didn ’ t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
That ’ s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . They ’ Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . Here , I brought these especially for you , try one !
Oh , thanks . Mmm , hmm , creamy texture , very smooth ...
Unique , aren ’ t they ? I bet you ’ Ve never tasted anything like it ! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one ’ s cutting corners with the ingredients . Only the creme make it through inspection .
Yes , very interesting flavors ... Slightly spicy , very unique , that ’ s for sure . Exactly what ARE the ingredients ?
I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations . I ’ m sure you can keep a secret . Buttermilk , cacao beans , sugar and Haggis .
Haggis ? What ’ s Haggis ?
It ’ s a traditional Scottish delicacy , you take sheep ’ s liver , heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep ’ s stomach .
Ah , get back to you .
What's in your bags ?
Those are something gifts I bought for my friends .
Would you mind opening it ?
Three . Two adults and one kid .
For buffet ?
Yes . How much do you charge for it ?
Thirty for each adult , twenty each kid .
I see . Where can I get the food ?
Please go to the tables over there for cold dishes and vegetables . The hot dishes are on the other side .
Do I need to pay extra charges for drinks like cola and juice ?
Just a second ... Sorry , the line is engaged .
OK , I ’ ll try later . Thanks anyway .
Yes , I am .
I'm Li Ming from CITS . Glad to see you .
Great . The view from this window is wonderful .
This is the kitchen .
It looks new .
Yes . We just renovated a few month ago .
I like it .
Here ’ s the master bedroom .
Wow , it ’ s nice . What did you say about the rent ?
$ 900 a month .
Does that include utilities ?
Yes . It includes electricity , water , gas and cable , but the telephone is extra .
When will it be available ?
The end of this month .
I like it a lot but I need to talk with my wife . Can you hold it for me for two days ?
Sure .
Thank you . I am very excited .
We are all very proud of you .
I am very happy , too . It was a big game and I won .
I watched the race with my children . We saw you run to the finish line . We all screamed with excitement .
Yes ?
How do I get to the Olympic Stadium , please ?
It ’ s not far . Go straight on then turn right at the end of the road .
Thanks .
All right . Should I take a look at your battery ?
No , thanks . I'm in a hurry . How much is it ?
Why ? Did you open an attachment ?
Yes , something called “ George W . Bush . ” An hour later , all I see are pictures of George W . Bush in women's clothes .
I kind of like it . He looks better that way , doesn't he ? More presidential .
I preferred the forward with pictures of him side-by-side with monkeys .
From 9 to 12 a . m . , and 2 to 6 p . m .
Can I ask for a leave ?
Of course , if necessary .
Are there any other jobs waiting for me in the future ?
Seldom .
That's OK . How can my salary be improved ?
It's Gone With the Wind .
Why do you like it best ?
I enjoy the various characters and the plot .
Well . I like the Thom Birds best .
Is it very interesting ?
Sure . I like the writer's language , too .
If I have a chance , I'll enjoy the book .
Would you like to go to the bookshop with me ?
It costs only 25 yuan .
Oh , it's too expensive . Can't you make it any cheaper ?
The price is reasonable because the quality is super .
But the price is too high .
How much would you like it to be , then ?
What about 15 yuan ?
Let's meet half way , 20 yuan , OK ?
All right , I'll take it .
I think you've got a real bargain .
Good evening , David.Good evening , Mary.It ' s so good of you both to come .
I studied at Anshan University .
Did you intern anywhere ?
Yes , I interned with an accounting firm during tax season .
That must have been stressful .
Yes , but I learned a lot .
I'll bet .
No , sir.Can I help you ?
I want sharing Company .
Good morning . I'd like to make a reservation to Guangzhou for August 2 .
Just a moment , please . I'm sorry , sir . There is no ticket available on that day . But we have flights for Guangzhou the next day .
May I inquire about the departure time ?
A 9:12 flight in the morning and a 14:00 flight in the afternoon .
When will the plane reach for the morning flight ?
At 13:15 .
OK . I'd like to book a ticket for this one .
Yes , we're hopping on the bandwagon and signing up for the union . Mostly people are pretty happy about it ... I guess it depends on if you are in management or in the labor force .
Management isn't looking on the labor unions too favorably , I'd guess . I don't blame them ... labor unions can really put the squeeze on the executives .
Sure , would you prefer looking in the morning or afternoon ?
I would prefer mornings .
Can you go during the week , or can you only go during the weekend ?
Going to look at houses during the week is best for me .
Where would you like me to pick you up ?
I will meet you at the real estate office .
I am thinking of looking at three houses , and it will take about two hours .
That sounds good to me .
Why ? It looks like a sunny day .
Looks can be deceiving .
What do you mean ?
It's very windy today .
But look , it's so sunny out .
It was me . I am so sorry .
What did you think you were doing ?
I had to move it , so that I can get my bike through .
How dare you be so inconsiderate ? That's wrong .
I am awfully sorry . I didn't think you would mind so much .
Never do that again .
What kind of business do you do ?
We send analysts to companies that run into financial difficulties .
What kind of clients do you prefer ?
Smaller local companies . We specialize in trade & shipping industry .
There is one next to the post office , round the corner .
What about going to the zoo on Saturday and to the park on Sunday ?
Sounds good . But on Saturday there's a football final .
Then , what shall we do on Sunday .
Let me see . We can visit the country . We haven't done that for such a long time .
Good idea . I'll go shopping in one of the department stores nearby . We'll go to the zoo and the park another time . After all , we can put that off .
You are speaking with Ryan . How can I help you ?
Ryan , this is Malia , and I need to call in sick today .
What seems to be the problem ?
I went hiking and have terrible poison oak .
When did you get that ?
I think I got it on Saturday , but it just showed up today .
What are you doing for it ?
The doctor prescribed an ointment and gave me a shot .
Everything looks so good . Is there anything in particular that you recommend ?
Hey , sis . You know me , if I don't like everything on the menu , I don't go back to the restaurant !
So you're saying I can't go wrong with anything I order ? In that case ...
Wait , you love salmon , don't you ? They have the best salmon pasta .
That sounds really good ! Does it come with a soup ?
Soup and bread and salad bar ! I'm telling you , these people know how to keep you coming back !
First , you should have enough sleep to get over the jet lag before the departure . Most people will suffer from jet lag for a few days after a long flight .
I will go to bed early tonight .
Do you have an airsickness ?
I don't know . But I have a carsickness .
You'd better bring some medicine for airsickness .
The salmon is good toady , it's very fresh .
How is it done ?
It's cooked with lemon and savored with rice .
Sound nice , I will try it .
You're meal also include soup and salad .
What's the soup of the day ?
French onion soup , sir , what dressing would you like for your salad ?
No , thanks . I have some trouble with my heart , my doctor recommend I to drink less .
Would you like to try some watermelon juice ? It tastes good .
I don ’ t understand . Why do you want a cat ?
Cats are beautiful and lovely , aren ’ t they ?
No , cats are too dirty . They are lazy and cunning . I don ’ t like them at all .
I don ’ t think so . I think cats are sweet .
I have had a low fever these days .
Don't worry . I'll write you a prescription for a new medicine that works wonders .
Would you like it rare , medium or well-done ?
May I have a look at your receipt ?
Oh , here you are .
I am going to the Capital Hotel .
Get in . I will take you there .
About how much it will cost ?
$ 50 .
On the meter ?
Ye , of course .
No , I haven't had a chance to take the exam as I have just arrived here .
Could you tell me about your professional education ?
We think the price is too high .
That's the best price we can offer .
We'll have to discuss it with my boss .
Yes . I want to rent a formal suit for an interview . Can you give me some advice ?
Yes . You should rent a brown suit and a black shirt .
May I try this on ?
Yes . I want to go to Beijing Hotel .
I'm sorry . You are going in the wrong direction .
Oh no ! What shall I do ?
Don't worry . You can get off at the next stop and go across the street through the overpass . The bus stop is right there .
Thank you very much .
Yeah . Li Na's mother has been building a fire under her since her neighbour's daughter got married with a Canadian . She's almost driving Li Na crazy .
If I were Li Na , I would ask her if she had done that .
Yes ?
Is this your handbag ?
Pardon ?
Is this your handbag ?
Yes , I think so .
Before we draft the contract , let's examine the details .
Ok , under this contract , we ’ ll supply you with 600 dozen T-shirts , S , M and L equally assorted , at USD 100 per dozen , CFR London . Shipment in July . Payment by irrevocable sight LC .
Perfect . But what I ’ m concerned about most is the time of delivery 。
You may rest assured that shipment will be effected within the time limits stipulated in the contract . But there is also one point I ’ d like to stress .
Yes ?
Your LC must be opened at least onemonth before the time shipment , otherwise we won't be able to catch the ship .
No problem . I ’ ll have the covering LC opened as soon as I wetback . In addition , would you tell me by whom the commodity inspection is conducted before shipment ?
The goods will be inspected by the China Import & Export Commodity Inspection Bureau . It will then issue certificate of quality and a certificate of weight . These will be taken as final and biding .
Please remember to use both English and Chinese versions and both versions should be equally valid .
Naturally . Each of us keeps one original and two copies .
Then I ’ ll come along three days later to put my signature on it .
I have to have at least eighteen to keep my scholarships and grant . But so far , I only have fifteen .
What's the matter , are the classes you want full ?
Yes . And now I'm down to either taking a class I'm not going to need or considering a double major .
If you were to take on a double major , what would be your first choice ?
I think with International Business a language would be appropriate .
Have you even thought that far ahead ? I mean what country would you like to do business with ?
Ah ! You're bleeding all over ! What happened ?
I was working in the garage and cut myself with my saw .
Here , use this rag to apply pressure to the cut . Does it hurt ?
No , not really , there's just a lot of blood .
You may just need stitches . I think they can handle this at the clinic instead of the ER . Let me make a quick phone call .
I'm going to go sit in the car while I still have the stomach to walk .
What kind of account do you want to open ?
I want to open a checking account .
Do you know the minimum balance you ’ re required to keep ?
How much is that ?
You have to maintain a minimum balance of $ 100 .
Really ?
Yes , really .
What if I can ’ t meet that requirement ?
You will be fined .
How much is the fine ?
See you !
I am a girl of many interests . I like dance , chess , collecting stamps , travelling and taking photos .
What kind of dance do you like ?
I like rumba and tango .
Great . I am not interested in Chinese chess . It is too difficult for me .
You can learn Chinese checkers or military chess . Both of them are much easier .
OK , I will try . As for stamp , don't you think it is an expensive hobby ?
Yes , it is . But it is full of fun and knowledge . What about you , what do you like to do as hobby ?
I like gardening . I take care of them everyday . I like those flowers and the swing in my garden . If the weather is nice , I would like to lie on the lawn .
Hey , sounds great to me , kid . What kind of job did you find ?
Job ?
Yes , job . If you ’ re going to live on your own , you have to pay for rent and everything else .
I thought I could just get you and Dad to pay for an apartment . I found a cheap one .
When you move out , your father and I aren ’ t paying your rent , young man . Get a job .
You ’ re right . If I ’ m going to live on my own , I have to be independent .
Good morning .
Would you like something to drink ?
No , thank you . I just had two cups of coffee at my desk .
So , you're a serious coffee drinker .
Yes , it keeps me going . Sometimes I think I'm addicted .
Well , coffee isn't such a bad thing.Everyone has to have something.For me , it's cigars . Are you a cigar smoker ?
No , I've tried them . But I'm not really a smoker .
Well , what would you like to talk to me about ?
I wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal .
I'm glad when people have new ideas around here . Tell me about it .
It is about the staff meetings.You know how we have a staff meeting every Tuesday .
Yes .
Well , I have been thinking about it.And I believe we could do things more efficiently here .
What do you suggest ?
The way it is now , the staff from all four branches get together once a week.We meet for one hour . But I think a lot of time is wasted in transportation .
You mean because people have to go across town to get here .
Yes . Some people spend half of the morning on the road .
That's true . But our staff meetings are very important , Arnold . I don't know how we can function without them .
I think they are important too.That ' s why I want people to have a better attitude about them .
I know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful . I'm aware of that .
Here's what I propose . I think we should meet once every two weeks , but meet for ninety minutes or more .
Well .
I also think the meetings should be more focused.And I would be willing to take responsibility for that .
You mean you want to run the meetings ?
No , not really run them . But I could help organize them . I could discuss meeting topics with you , and then prepare a schedule for each meeting . I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting.This way the meetings would become more focused , and people would prepare better .
Hmm . But we would meet every two weeks .
I really think it would work.The meetings could be longer , and better organized .
I am not against the idea , Arnold.It may really be more efficient , as you say . I'll tell you what we can do.Why don't we try your proposal for a month , and see how it works .
Excellent . I would be happy to get started on it .
What's it ?
You must have rolled over something just now .
I've got a Remittance Advice and I'd like to cash it .
I can do that for you . Could I see the Remittance slip ?
Here you are . I'm here on business and this is from my boss , it's for my expenses so I need cash .
That's no problem . The amount is 2,000 RIB , is that correct ?
Yes , that's right .
I just need to see some identification before I hand over the cash .
Wow ! Why so much ? I thought they were getting you an assistant .
They were supposed to , but so far nobody ’ s turned up , and I ’ m left on my own to do the work . This is the first break I ’ Ve had all day .
No way .
But we'll be careful .
What happened ? We're all expecting you , Hans , Dick , Archie ...
I'm so sorry , I've been held up by the damn traffic jam for half an hour . I'd have arrived but for that .
I see . Where are you now , Li ?
Thirty meters ahead is the Waterloo Bridge .
It's not far away from home , It's - let me see – about 20 minutes'walk , Can you walk here ?
I've thought of that , but what can I do with my car ? If only I had taken a taxi !
That's too bad , But don't worry.We ' ll put off dinner till one o'clock .
I'm so terribly sorry to keep you waiting .
It doesn't matter.Bye .
Five days a week , too ?
Actually , five and a half.On Saturday , we have classes only in the morning .
Gosh !
That's too much for us really .
Where are you going now ?
I'm going to try to find out where the school is located .
When do you start school ?
I'm going to register right now .
Sunny-side up , please .
The toaster is over there on the kitchen counter . Help yourself .
What kind of bread do we have ?
White and whole-wheat .
I think I'll have two slices of whole wheat .
Can you go wake up Cindy for me ?
Sure .
Yes , we can also see some yew trees .
This is a great botanical garden in the city .
Listen to the sound of nature ! It's like music .
Yeah , I agree.It makes you feel really good .
What are those . Miss Liu ?
Do you mean the red flowers ? They are peony flowers ?
The red and yellow peony flowers are so beautiful .
Yes , you like them very much . right ?
Sure . I'm going to take more pictures today .
I can help you with it
I've been looking forward to visiting your factory .
Actually , you'll know our products better after the visit . I'll show you around and explain the operations as we go along .
That'll be most helpful .
Maybe we could start with the Design Department . And then we could look at the production line .
How much do you spend on design development every year .
About 10 % of the gross sales .
Hold on there , Fittipaldi , first let ’ s go over things one more time . Now before you even think of starting the car , make sure your seat is at a comfortable position and you can grip the steering wheel firmly . Next check your rear view mirrors to make sure you can see properly .
We have been through this a million times ! Let ’ s get going already ! I ’ m ready !
Fine , start the car . now gently step on the clutch and shift to 1st gear . Good , now accelerate gently and let go of the clutch as you do it . There we go , good !
I ’ m doing it ! I ’ m driving ! This is awesome ! Let ’ s turn some music on !
Keep your eyes on the road ! No music ! We are coming up to a red light , step on the brakes . What are you doing ? I said the brakes ! Look out for those people ! Get off the sidewalk !
Get out of my way ! This is just like playing video games !
It ’ s the police ! Pull over !
Yes , but now we are fresh out of staff quarters .
How will you solve the problem ?
Beijing University . Do you know where it is located ?
Yes , of course . I live near the university . Hop in please .
Would you please help me with my luggage ?
Okay , we'll put it in the trunk . Ah , it is so heavy .
Yes , I packed my books in it . Thank you .
Thank you for hiring me . I'm very proud to be employed by your firm .
You are expected to report for on-job training on the 15th of May . Will you be there ?
I certainly hope so . Can we arrange to meet on the 27th ? That should give you enough time .
Yes , sir . That ’ s more than enough time . I do appreciate your understanding . Why don ’ t we say 10:00 o ’ clock on the 27th ?
It would be my pleasure to help you . What do you need help with ?
I picked up some poison oak while hiking , and I can ’ t stop itching .
We have Techne , and it is available in lotion or cream .
Do you find that one works better than the other ?
I have heard that the cream is longer lasting .
Is there anything I can take that will help with the itching ?
If you take an antihistamine , that would help a lot .
Thank you for helping me figure out what to do with my poison oak .
OK . You have to fill out this form and let me see three identification cards or documents .
I have a driver's licence , a membership card and my passport . Will they do ?
Let me see them . Yes , they're OK .
What's the minimum amount I can deposit in an account ?
You can deposit an initial amount of ten dollars .
I'm just poring over some brochures about various car models .
Oh , so you're thinking about buying a new car ?
Yeah , it looks that way . My wife has been bugging me about it . I thought we could probably survive without one , but with a baby on the way , maybe it is time to get a car .
So this would be your first automobile ?
That's right . For quite a few years , I rode a bicycle to work . Then I got a motorbike .
Yeah , I think I can understand your wife's position . Asking her to ride on a motorcycle when she's pregnant is a tall order .
Oh ... I don't let her ride with me . It's just too dangerous . She takes the bus to work , but it is sometimes difficult to get a seat and it's crowded and hot .
So it's time to buy your very first car ! Wow , that's exciting !
Yes , but it's also a pretty big financial responsibility .
Yeah . I still remember my first car . It was an old clunker that my dad gave me when I turned 17 . I drove it around for a couple of years until I scraped together enough money to buy a better secondhand car .
I'm having a hard time deciding which model is best for us .
Yeah , it is a tough call . Each one has its pros and cons . Are you looking for a sedan ?
Yes , I'd like a Jeep , but my wife says we have to get a comfortable sedan for long drives home to see her relatives .
What's the matter ?
My wife has found that I have an affair with my secretary , and now she is going to divorce me .
How could you cheat on your wife ? You have been married for ten years .
Yes , I know I'm wrong . But I swear that the affair lasts only for two months . And I still love my wife . I couldn't live without her .
I will try my best to persuade her to reconsider the divorce . But are you sure that from now on you will be faithful to her forever ?
Sure , we have several different styles you may choose . How high of a heel do you want ?
Not to high , maybe an inch or an inch in the half would be the best .
In that case , I might have just the pair for you . Look at these , they were made in Italy , the leather is very soft , so your toes will not get pinched . You can tell just by looking at it that it was superbly made .
Those are beautiful . Do you have any in a size six ?
Yes , we do , we also have this same style in dark blue and red .
No , thank you . I'm just looking for a black pair .
I'd like to buy a ticket to Casablanca on flight US125 tomorrow .
Hold on , plese.It will take off at 14:00 tomorrow.The price is $ 110 .
Well , I want to stay under $ 100 .
I'll give you mine too .
How was your flight ?
Not bad , but I'm a little tired .
Here's your schedule . After this meeting , we will visit the factory and have another meeting with the production manager . And you'll be having dinner with our director .
Could you arrange a meeting with your boss ?
Of course . I've arranged it at 10 0 ' clock tomorrow morning .
Well , shall we get down to business ' .
Sure , did you receive the sample we sent last week ?
Yes , we finished the evaluation of it . If the price is acceptable we would like to order now .
I'm very glad to hear that .
What's your best price for that item ?
The unit price is $ 12.50 .
I think the price is a little high , can't you reduce it
I'm afraid we can't . $ 12.50 is our rock bottom price . If you purchase more than 10,000 units we can reduce it to $ 12.00 .
Well , I'll accept the price and place an initial order of 10,000 units .
Very good . It's been a pleasure to do business with you , Mr . Smith .
The pleasure is ours . Can you deliver the goods by March 31 ?
Your main responsibility is trouble-shooting between top management and the general employees .
Will I have the chance to take business trip abroad once in a while ?
I was in my friend's room , talking for an hour or so .
And then ?
I came back to my room and found my suitcase was open and my camera and five hundred dollars in cash inside the wallet were gone .
I'm afraid you must give up the cash . Are you insured ?
Yes , this is my overseas travel accident insurance card .
Your job includes paper filing a lot . Anc you will have to check and fill the stationer cabinet regularly . Besides , you have to reserve the meeting room in advance if the are any important visitors .
Got it . To whom should I report ?
Have you decided what wine you would like ?
I have no idea . Maybe you can give me some advice .
I recommend you the white wine . It will wake up your appetite .
Do you know how many you need ?
I think I can get by with 2,000 .
We can get started as soon as you fill out this form .
I hope you can make the new cards just like my old cards .
You won't be able to tell the difference with a magnifying glass .
... Okay , I'm through . Here's the form and my old card .
Very good . You can pick up your order in one week .
Now that I think of it , three days is better than seven .
No problem . But , the postage is much higher than the regular package .
That's fine with me . I am willing to pay for it as long as you can guarantee me the package can arrive in time .
OK . All the registered airmail packages can be received in 5 working days .
I see . How much do I need to pay in total for this package ?
It's 500 dollars .
Can I have the receipt ? Just in case I can trace it if something goes wrong .
Sure ! Please just fill in your I . D . number and ways to contact you here .
Do I need to include my zip code in the address ?
You had better include that because it is easier for the mailmen to find the correct mailing address .
Thank you very much . Here is 500 dollars .
What do you mean ?
Roman is living in Rome , of course . And go to work by car , or bus , or on foot .
I think the Romans do what everyone else does .
Certainly .
And Roman really loves life . He knows how to enjoy himself .
Not always . But they like good meal .
Really ?
How can I go there to have a taste ?
I stopped you for driving through a red light .
Did I really ?
You didn't know ?
I had no idea that I ran it .
Don't you know that yellow means slow down ?
Yes , madam .
Why'd you speed up instead ?
I really have no excuse , madam .
I'll have to write you a ticket .
I understand , and I am very sorry .
All right . But I don't want to play tennis . We played tennis last weekend .
Okay . what do you want to do ?
I want to go jogging .
Ten to nine .
Your watch is ten minutes slow . So it's should be nine sharp . I'm gonna be late again . What will be my excuse this time ? It should be set the alarm for seven thirty .
Don't cry over spilled milk , Fred ? Could you stay with me a few minutes ?
What ? Why ? What's wrong with you ?
I just hate being alone at home with nothing to do about listen to the clock ticking.It ' s so lonely and boring . My sickness makes it worse . When will I recover ?
You will be fine in the couple of month , just be patient . I've got to woke now , I'll be late .
You only care about your work .
Sorry , baby , you are everything to me . all I do just for our family .
Stay just a few minutes longer , OK ?
OK , I'll leave at 9:15 , Is that all right ?
Yes .
I'll spent more time with you in the future , Dina .
I am preparing a birthday party for Julia .
Can I be of any help to you ?
Of course , could you help to blow up some balloons ?
I hate balloons .
Well , would you please clean the livingroom ? You know I'm too busy .
The board has been considering introducing flex time .
Good news . Ah , what if be even better if alternative work place is provided .
I didn't want to go out last weekend , so I decided to stay at home and watch a movie .
Why didn't you want to go out ?
I was very tired after working all week . Sometimes on the weekend I don't have enough energy to go out to a movie theater .
Did you download a movie or rent it at the store ?
Yes ?
Could I have one more blanket ?
I'm afraid there aren't any left at the moment . Gan you wait just a little while ?
OK . I will .
I'll bring you one as soon as I find one available .
I would like a cup of decaf with cream and no sugar .
Would you like anything else with that ?
How fresh is that apple pie over there ?
Our pie is brought in fresh every day . And I can tell you it's delicious .
Okay , throw in a piece of that pie then .
Is this to stay or to go ?
Cool , fellow , what's the date today , buddy ?
It's ... oh it's the 1st April , April Fool's Day .
Thank you very much .
And here is your birthday present .
A gold watch !
Do you like it ?
Thank you for your instruction . I really need to know the rules before I play the game , so I can know more about our company .
The working hours are from 9:00 to 11:30 in the morning and from 1:30 to 5:30 in the afternoon . Make sure never to be late or absent . Every time you should use the employee card to show you are present whenever you come into the company .
Set your heart at rest . I keep this in my mind .
Same here . I've been looking forward to this .
I ’ m sorry I kept you waiting so long . I'm running a little late today .
No problem . That happens to all of us , it goes badly with the traffic .
Thank you . Can I offer you some refreshment ?
What is it ?
You have to take the math and English evaluation tests .
Why ?
Because you're from a foreign country . The school needs to find out how good you are at both basic skills .
It's so that I can be put into the right math and English classes , right ?
You are a smart girl !
I see . Well , can I have a look at your phone ? Unfortunately , this phone can ’ t be used in the US , it ’ s not compatible with our 3G network .
What ? Really ? I don ’ t really want to have to buy a new phone .
Well , you ’ re in luck ! You see , if you sign up for our three-year plan , we ’ ll throw in a handset for free .
Really ? What ’ s the catch ?
There ’ s no catch ! You just choose a plan , sign a three-year contract and , that ’ s it ! Actually , we ’ re running a special promotion right now , and we ’ re giving away a Blackberry Curve with our special Mega Value forty dollar plan .
So what does this plan include ?
Well , you get nine hundred anytime minutes , and you can also enjoy free mobile to mobile calling to other Tel-Mobile clients , one thousand text messages per month , and unlimited evening and weekend minutes . Oh , and we also offer a rollover option .
Wow , all this for forty dollars per month ?
Our computer lab on the first floor has a copy machine , sir .
Great ! How much per copy ?
Sir , one copy is ten cents .
Okay , I'll be down there shortly .
Yes . And you're Paul , right ? Paul Hill ?
Yes , it's me . And you're Julie Ashley . How are you ?
I'm fine . After ten years , you still look great !
So do you ! How are you doing ?
Not bad . Let's find a table and sit down . We have a lot to talk about .
Oh , that's George . He looks very drunk .
What's he like normally ?
Oh , he's really reserved , normally . But , from what I hear , he's got lots of problems .
Really ? What kind of problems ?
Well , off the record , of course , but I hear that he's got terrible debts . He has his own company , and it's not going very well .
Really ? Well , I hate to say this , but I'm not surprised .
Really ? What makes you say that ?
Well , he doesn't look very honest .
I know , that's the problem . He can't find any customers . It's a pity , really , because his products are very good . Oh , that reminds me . Did I tell you about my new laptop ?
Oh , don't talk to me about laptops . Mine crashed on Friday and I lost everything . I hate them .
Oh , really ?
Look , I need another drink . Do you want one ?
Yes , I'll have another cocktail .
Vodka martini ?
Absolutely .
I'll be back in a sec .
Adaptability and sense of humor .
How would your friends or colleagues describe you ?
( Pause a few seconds ) They say Mr . Chen is an honest , hardworking and responsible man who deeply cares for his family and friends .
What personality traits do you admire ?
Honest , flexible and easy-going .
What leadership qualities did you develop as an administrative personnel ?
I feel that learning how to motivate people and to work together as a team will be the major goal of my leadership .
How do you normally handle criticism ?
Silence is golden . Just don't say anything ; otherwise the situation could become worse . I do , however , accept constructive criticism .
What do you find frustrating in a work situation ?
Sometimes , the narrow-minded people make me frustrated .
How do you handle your conflict with your colleagues in your work ?
I will try to present my ideas in a more clear and civilized manner in order to get my points across .
To secure employment hopefully with your company .
How long would you like to stay with this company ?
I really love this music . It's a compilation .
I know . It's a mix of all the latest songs .
And you got them off the Net ?
No . I recorded these from your Cds .
Well , thanks for asking for my permission ... Now hand it over and let me record !
Sure , When is good time for you ?
Can you make it on Tuesday ?
What time do you want me there ?
Anytime after six will be fine .
Yes , we have several rooms available . Would you like two twin beds or one queen size bed ?
I'd like two twin beds , please .
The check in time is 2 p . m . If you get here before that time the room won't be ready .
That's fine . Do you have any specials for your guests ?
We offer a complementary breakfast buffet and free parking .
Good . Let me give you my credit card number to reserve a room .
How about going to the theatre ?
I don ’ t like going to the theatre .
Well , what do you like doing ?
traveling , swimming , going to the cinema . And you ?
I like painting , sailing , watching football and talking to you .
I like talking to you too .
Do you want to go to an Exhibition ? There ’ s one of xinghai exhibitions hall tomorrow .
Yes.That ' s from 6:30 to 9:00 in the dinning room .
Do I have to pay extra money for it ?
No , it's already included in your room fare .
I ’ m just looking for a nice pillow on Ebay .
You are shopping for a pillow online ? That ’ s absurd !
Why ? I don ’ t have to leave the house or browse a dozen stores to find what I ’ m looking for . This way , I just search for it online quick and easy .
I see , but how do you pay for it ? How do you know you aren ’ t going to be ripped off by the seller ?
Well , the website handles a point system where if the seller does something wrong , people comment negatively and then you know that he or she may not be trustworthy .
Wow , that sounds pretty safe . So how do you pay ? Do you need a credit card ?
You can use a credit card or your debit card . They also let you use the Paypal system which is really safe and fast . I have never had any problems with someone hacking my information or anything .
Do you think I can find a sweater for my dog online ?
You can find anything ! Are you sure you want to start shopping online though ? Once you step into this world , there is no turning back !
Sorry , I'm afraid the hotel is full on those dates.Shall I contact another hotel for you ?
Uh , yes , they are .
Moooooommmmm ! You're so in ! Anything else you've been keeping from me ?
What ?
Any body piercing ? Stick out your tongue !
Oh , for Pete's sake . This is cosmetic . My brows are falling out . I did this for convenience .
Come on mom . I'm your A ! Wait till the guys hear about this !
Would she like a laptop ?
That sounds like a good idea .
A Mac is a very popular brand .
She mentioned a Mac . How much is it ?
A 15 - inch Pro model is $ 2,100 plus tax .
That sounds like a great price . I'll take one .
This is a gift she'll cherish for years . How do you want to pay ?
I'll use my VISA .
We're almost through . Just sign here , please .
Just take it home and plug it in ?
She'll be online 20 minutes after she opens the box .
She's going to be so pleased with this .
Yes , I have two large suitcases and one box .
If you need baggage tags , they are found in the box on your right .
No , thank you.They are already tagged with my name and address .
You are allowed an additional two carry-on items .
Good , I have my backpack and my camera tripod .
I see . All carry-on items must be able to fit under the seat or in the overhead bin .
Both my items will fit under the seat or in the overhead bin .
You will need to send the tripod as luggage because it is too long to fit in our gauge box for carry-on items .
I cannot let anything happen to that tripod.Can you guarantee it will not be damaged if I check it in ?
No , I can't . Perhaps your stewardess will help you to find a place to store it .
I can't , I have to go to the gym .
Come on ! You can go tomorrow , just skip it today . It's not as if you are gonna get in trouble !
Actually I will ! I am working out with a personal trainer that gets on my case if I don't go . I like it , because it makes me feel more obligated to go and get healthy .
That's cool , does your personal trainer basically teach you how to work out ?
Yeah . He makes a work put plan depending on the areas I want to work on , or the muscles I want to build . Like for example in order to get better muscle tone in my abs , pecs and biceps , he makes me work out with free weights . Then for my quads , calves and hamstrings , I do leg lifts or squats .
Do you need money or what ?
I have this list of stuff that I need and I only have half the dough .
Half the dough huh . Well . How would you like to earn the other half ?
Do I have a choice ? Uh . That's a no . What can I do ?
Thanks to you . I'm totally pumped up .
So you are happy that you made the decision to join us .
I surely am . But still there is one single problem .
What's that ?
I eat more and more these days . And it puts even more weight on me .
It's not good to start with too much work-out at the beginning . What about trying something else ?
I'd love to do that . What do you recommend ?
More and more people are warm up to Yoga these days . Do you want to have a try ?
Do you think it's a good option for health and relaxation ?
Absolutely . But it takes great perseverance to master .
I can so that .
Here is a free class going on right over there . Go and join them .
How did it go ?
I ’ m making a shopping-list , Tom .
What do we need ?
We need a lot of things this week . I must go to the grocer's . We haven't got much tea or coffee , and we haven't got any sugar or jam .
What about vegetables ?
I must go to the greengrocer's . We haven ; t got many tomatoes , but we've got a lot of potatoes . I must go to the butcher's , too . We need some meat . We haven't got any meat at all .
Have we got any beer and wine ?
No , we haven't . And I'm not going to get any !
I hope that you've got some money .
I haven't got much .
My name is Jung Min . What's your name ?
My name is Jessica . It's nice to meet you .
Yes . It's nice to meet you too . Are you a new student too ?
No . I'm a sophomore . I take it you are a new student ?
Yeah . It's pretty exciting to be here .
Have fun while it lasts . The excitement wears off real quick . Especially after you see how much homework you get . Where are you from ?
I'm from Korea . My parents wanted me to go to an American university , so I came here .
I have never been to Korea . I've been to Japan before , but never Korea .
Why were you in Japan ?
My father thought it would be a good experience to take a vacation to a different country . He's so into learning about different cultures .
That's pretty cool .
I thought it would have been more fun if I went without my parents .
Well , if you ever want to visit Korea , I would be happy to show you around .
Thanks for the offer . I'll keep that in mind . Oh , the professor is coming . We'll talk more after class .
It's a little embarrassing really ; you see I think I've got a counterfeit note .
Do you remember where you got it ?
No , I don't . Usually I'm very careful about checking the money I'm given , but for some reason this one slipped through .
Counterfeit notes these days can be very sophisticated and difficult to spot with the naked eye . But I must warn you that if it does show to be a counterfeit I have no option but to confiscate it .
I understand . To be honest , I'll be glad to get rid of it if it is a fake .
I ’ Ve looked over your resume , ms.Jane . I see you ’ Ve already have quite a lot of experience in secretary work , could you tell me something about your talent with that company ?
Oh , yes , I worked there for two years , just graduated from college .
En ?
It was a good company to work for , I enjoyed my time with them .
You like that work ?
Yes , I like it very much , the work was not very demanding , and the people I work with were friendly .
Why do you want to leave the company ?
Good morning , John !
I want to have a few friends over for a dinner party to celebrate my birthday . Would you be able to come the next weekend on Saturday ?
I'd be delighted to , John . Saturday did you say ?
Yes , if that's all right for you .
I'm pretty sure I'll be all right . In fact , I'd be delighted to come over and celebrate your birthday with you . What time are you planning to start ?
Oh , good . If you could come around six thirty or seven o'clock , that would give us some time to chat a whit over a glass of wine before dinner .
I'd like to work in a law firm to enrich my experience and put what I've learned into practice .
Have you had any previous experience ?
Well . During the college years , I worked as a trainee every summer at lawyer's offices . Does that count ?
Of course it counts . What kind of work did you do there ?
I did clerical stuff and ran errands .
In this office , we encourage full attendance by offering a bonus . If you take any leaves , we'll deduct money from your salary .
May I know about the office hours ?
Office hours are nine to five-thirty . One hour for lunch . Do you have any questions ?
Er , may I know how much I will be paid monthly ?
We'll give you about 3000 to start . There'll be a trial period of three month . After six months , we'll have a job performance review and consider giving you a raise .
When will I know your decision ?
I'll call you in a day or two , did you write down your phone number on your resume ?
Yes , I did . Can you call after 7 p . m . ? I'm usually out in the daytime .
All right . Good-bye .
Yes , I'd like to make an appointment to see the doctor . My name is Randy Horn .
Let's see , Mr . Horn ... The doctor's schedule is full today . Would tomorrow be all right ?
Yeah , I guess I can survive until tomorrow .
Would you prefer to come in in the morning or the afternoon ?
In the morning , if possible .
The doctor has an opening at 10:30 tomorrow . I'll put you down for then .
That would be fine .
Some routine job . Files , documents , faxes and so on .
Are you usually busy ?
It depends . Sometimes I am very busy .
What depends ?
Oh , that means I can't make sure for my own .
I am leaving at 10 , so I'd like to settle my account now .
Yes , sir . May I have your room number ?
My room number is 1010 and the name is Ted Black .
Right , just wait a minute . I will get your bill ready for you right away .
Thanks .
Have you used your mini-bar since breakfast ?
No , I haven't .
Very good sir . Here is your bill . Please check and sign it .
Ok . Excuse me , what's this charge for ?
That's for the breakfast you ordered from the service .
Oh , yes . It's on Wednesday morning . Sorry about that .
That's all right . Well , it's all together $ 260 .
Here you are .
No . Does the newspaper say what has caused that ?
Yes . It says the hike was a result of purchase rush in the fourth quarter on expectations of tightening politics .
I think the government should make a serves of moves to cool the market .
Hey , Anna , this is Jason .
Jason , where have you been hiding lately ? You know it's been a long time since your last call . Have you been good ?
Yes . How are you , Anna ?
I am fine . What have you been doing ?
Working . I've been really busy these days . I got a promotion .
That's great , congratulations !
Thanks . I am feeling pretty good about myself too . You know , bigger office , a raise and even an assistant .
That's good . So I guess I'll have to make an appointment to see you .
You are kidding .
How long have you been working there ?
A bit over two years . This is a fast-moving company , and seniority isn ’ t the only factor in deciding promotions .
How do you like your new boss ?
She is very nice and open-minded .
Much better than the last one , huh ?
Yeah . He was a real slave driver . He probably would have loved it if we were robots .
Forget about him . Come over to my house tonight . Let's get drunk .
Good . Tonight 8 o'clock .
8 it is . See you then .
Hi , I am just looking .
It's a good car .
What year is it ?
1999 .
How about the mileage ?
6,000 miles , all highway mileage .
What do you mean 7B
Highway miles are not as bad as local miles . They do not hurt car as much .
Oh , why such a high mileage ?
The owner was commuting everyday crossing the state line .
Okay . Does this car have a warranty ?
One month .
How do I make sure I am not buying a junk ?
You'll check it out anyway you want . You can take it to a garage .
How much is it ?
$ 5,900 .
I'll have to think about it .
Leave your phone number , and I will give you a call if the price gets reduced .
Well , there ’ s no doubt that lots of people have found employment in the help wanted section .
Right , so I picked up a copy of the Sunday Globe this morning .
Did you get a copy of the Herald too ?
No , why should I ? The Globe ’ s help wanted section is the best .
That ’ s true , but still the Herald lists some jobs the Globe doesn ’ t have .
Not enough to worry about . Why do I waste the money buying two papers ?
It's only a couple of dollars more . For that much money you can afford to risk it .
I guess you ’ re right . I'll get a Herald as soon as I finish looking over the Globe .
Yes . They are over there .
Do you sell them individually or by weight ?
By weight . 6.0 cents per pound .
Could you weigh these , please ?
$ 4.55 , please . Anything else ?
A sack of cherries , please .
Oh , great ! Let's discuss it together . Now , when am I off then ?
You're leaving on Tuesday morning .
What time exactly ?
Your flight takes off at 8
Oh , am I seeing Mr . Li ?
Yes , you're seeing him on Thursday . You're inspecting the factory in the morning and having dinner with him in the evening .
I've got a schedule !
Sorry , Mr . Wood is not here right now . Do you have any message for him ?
I will call again in twenty minutes . Thanks .
What are those ?
They are the things that make up the atom , such as electrons and protons .
Is there anything that is smaller than electrons and protons ?
Of course there is . Things can be divided and broken down into indefinitely small parts if we can .
Yes , sir . What can I do for you ?
This is Room 705 . The air conditioner in my room doesn't work .
I'll have that taken care of immediately .
And may I have two more towels , please ?
No problem . We'll bring you the towels in just a minute .
Do you know in which area ?
No , I am sorry I have no idea . I am a stranger here .
I see . Well , do you know anything near the hotel ?
Oh , yes . My friend told me the hotel was near the Central Railway Station .
Then you'll have to take a bus and get off at the Central Railway Station .
Can you show me where the Central Railway Station is on this map ?
It seems quite normal to me . It is pretty much what I want to do .
But what about settling down to start a family ? Doesn't anyone want to get married any more ?
It is different now . The world is becoming colorful . Some of my friends don't feel the same pressure to marry . We all want to wait for the right moment .
What time is the right moment ?
Can ’ t be better , it was wonderful . We had a lot of fun there . There was so much joy and walk and breathe the winter air . We arrived at the park at 9 o ’ clock in the morning and didn ’ t leave till 3 o ’ clock in the afternoon .
You had been walking for 6 hours , isn ’ t that boring ?
Of course not ! We built a snowman , some snow dogs and one big snow fort . We went sliding on the nice hill . It was a real work out . At noon , we had the most special winter picnic outside . Fortunately , we got it all on a video tape . You must come with us next time . I bet you will love it .
I have a spasm of nausea and dizziness .
Have you ever suffered from airsickness before ? You're probably airsick .
No , this is the first time on a plane . Maybe you are right .. Please get me some pills .
OK . I will get some for you . There's an airsickness bag behind the seat in front of you.Please wait me for a moment . ( Go away for a few minutes , and now she comes back . ) Here are two pills . And the water is in the glass too.Please take the pills with water .
Thank you very much . ( Take the pills . )
Are you feeling better now ?
Much better now . Thanks again .
You're right . I think it's going to rain later .
In the middle of the summer , it shouldn't be raining .
That wouldn't seem right .
Considering that it's over ninety degrees outside , that would be weird .
Exactly , it wouldn't be nice if it started raining . It's too hot .
I know , you're absolutely right .
I wish it would cool off one day .
That's how I feel , I want winter to come soon .
I enjoy the winter , but it gets really cold sometimes .
I know what you mean , but I'd rather be cold than hot .
Thank you for your entertaining me .
Today I'll invite you to enjoy the seafood.Please make yourself at home .
Excuse me , what business are you looking after in Germany ?
I am running Chinese arts and crafts .
What arts and crafts are you interested in this time ?
I hope to import some silk from Hangzhou to Germany . Can you help me ?
It's hard to believe that we're really leaving . The past two weeks was like a dream .
Yes . Just think the blue sky , sunshine , mouth-watering food , centuries-old castles - -
And the people were so friendly !
Yeah , we would have been lost without the help of the locals .
Do you still remember the small restaurant at the corner of the street ?
Of course . That was the best pasta I've ever had .
I ate so much that I wasn't hungry until afternoon the next day .
If only we could eat there once more !
Maybe we can come here again next summer .
Hope the restaurant is still there .
Hey , what's the time ?
Oh , my god ! Only two hours left before the plane takes off . We need to be at the airport now .
Aha . I've read of my roommate . I made a move today .
Really ? What was the matter ?
You knew Brain Locker ?
Brain Locker ? No , I don't think so . What does he look like ?
Well , he's thin and tall . He has brown hair , a holt nose , green eyes and wearing glasses .
Would you please fill out this registration 1 form ?
Thank you ... Excuse me , sir . You forgot to fill in your visa number .
I need some stamps for this letter .
What kind of stamps do you want ?
How much do I need for this letter ?
I must weigh it first . Err ... It's five grams over weigh , Do you want to send it as an ordinary or registered letter ?
I want it registered . How much is it then ?
Registration plus overnight ... err ... seven dollars in all .
Here's a 10 - dollar bill .
Now , your receipt , and the change .
It's worth it just to go and eat what the mafia eat ! The five-dollar tiramisu is a culinary orgasm .
Such a thing exists ?
Fortunately , yes . You're blushing !
Am I ? Um ... my face gets red when I walk too fast .
Well , it is still open . Where did you graduate from .
I graduated from the Beijing Foreign Studies University . My major is English Translation and Interpretation .
It sounds great . I will arrange an interview tomorrow . Can you come tomorrow ?
Sorry , but he's not in . May I take a message for you ?
This is Robert Jordan.Would you ask him to call me back , please ?
I wish to buy a diamond ring .
How many carats would you like it to be ?
I want five carats .
Is this one suitable for you ?
No , it seems too old-fashioned to my fiancee .
What about this ?
It seems too small for me , haven't you got any larger ones ?
Then you can buy this one . It's very nice and latest in style .
We're here today to present to you the results of our marketing research regarding the consumer behavior .
I would like to begin by introducing our foreign guests to our stuff on your left ( right ) , we have Mr . Brown , who is Vice President of Sales . Next to him is Ms . Arts , Director of Marketing for the Atlas Company . In the back row is Dr . Barolo , who is visiting from Italy . Thank you all for coming .
What's he like ?
Oh , he's a very serious person .
What's the matter ?
Every time I try to start this program , the computer freezes .
Sir , according to your file , you spent Monday evening watching ' Titanic . '
Well , the file is wrong . I was at a great concert that night .
Well , this wouldn't be the first time that a file was wrong . Just a moment , please .
Thank you for taking care of it so quickly .
Sir , when I deleted the $ 10 , the program automatically added a $ 2 service charge .
You can't do that ! You can't charge me for a mistake that you made !
Sometimes you can't win for losing , sir .
Well , now I've seen it all ! What a rip-off this place is !
Working for your company , as the top administrative assistant in your firm !
Good answer , B - good answer ! Seriously , though , are you interested in staying in a staff-level position , or would you hope to move into management someday ?
Yes , you have to work overtime a lot due to the editing job .
Is there any extra pay for that ?
Oh , no , Nathan , I ... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time , you know . Market prices are going to go up , and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more .
But we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating . I think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished .
But don't you like this place ? I remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely .
Well , only you liked it really , darling .
Why ? I'd like to see what's on that channel .
A lecture on how to make stir-fried ginger beef , not the boxing you like .
Yes , it is very expensive . Maybe we shouldn't have come here .
But the guidebook says a lot of the stars come here.If we are spending three days in Hollywood , I want to see at least one star .
I think we might not see any .
Did you like the tour of Universal Studios ?
I thought it was O . K . But it really was too hot.And I think they should show people more . The exhibits should be more interesting .
I thought it was great . Didn't you like the special effects rooms ?
What size do you take ?
I'm sorry . I don't know .
I'll measure you . . . You take size 6 . What colour hat would you like ?
Brown , please .
Here are some nice brown hats.Try this hat on.It ' s a very good one .
Yes , I like this one.It goes very well with my coat . How much is it ?
Yes , I have received an Engineer's Qualification Certificate and a driver's license .
How many years have you had the driver's license ?
I have two years driving experience .
That's good . What special skills do you have , can you tell me ?
I have experience in computer operation , proficiency in Microsoft Windows , Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel .
What computer languages have you learned ?
Visual C + + , C and Delphi .
Have you gotten any special training in programming ?
No , I don't , do you ?
Yes . Maybe you should do it too . You may not get enough vitamins from your food , you know .
But , I don't believe in taking pills to get enough vitamins .
How's that .
Please . Everyone enjoys hearing the benefits of something !
With this agreement we can bring over you many benefits . For example , head offices of your group companies can get really prompt integrated fund transfers and centralised allocations . This helps internal supervision and admin run smoothly .
That is wonderful . We've been having serious problems in that area . Our internal accounts seem so messy at the moment , nothing is running smoothly and it's costing us time and money .
I have made a reservation for this Sunday . My name is Bobby
Yes , that's right . Your room is a single one with a bath .
I am calling to cancel it now . I can't go to your city this week .
Fine , we will cancel it .
Sure , what gives ?
Today Mr . Leo threw Sally out of class !
On the level ?
I ’ ll say . I knew Sally would finally show her true colors . When she got her final test results back from Mr . Leo , she started yelling at him . You should have heard her . I ’ Ve never seen anyone get so upset before . To make a long story short , it seems that Mr . Leo failed her because he caught her cheating .
That ’ s no laughing matter . That means she ’ ll have to take the whole course again . I can ’ t believe she ’ s going to have to start from the beginning .
Follow me and I will lead you to your seat .
Thank you . Can you please put my luggage in the overhead bin for me ?
Of course .
Something awful happened . We went to the Portobello Road , and someone stole my handbag .
Oh , dear . Did you lose a lot of money ?
No . Only a few pounds . But my passport was in the bag . That ’ what I ’ m really worry about .
You must tell the embassy about it . And I think they ’ ll issue you with a new one .
I ’ d better go tomorrow .
What did you do ?
I watered all the plants .
You have a lot of plants .
Then I did my laundry .
That takes some time .
I took the dog for a walk .
I'll bet he enjoyed his walk .
I vacuumed the entire house .
That's a lot of work .
And then I made lunch .
Sure . What is it ?
I don't know how to say it in English .
We call this a ' parking meter ' .
Oh , Thank you . But how do you spell it ?
Hey Tina . What are you doing ?
I was just watching TV . What's going on with you ?
I just watched a movie and I'm scared .
What did you watch ?
I saw the Sixth Sense . I didn't know it was going to be so scary .
I remember that . It was a great movie . But it was definitely scary .
If you're not busy , do you want to come over ? I'm afraid to be alone .
Sure . I can come over . What should we do ?
How about if we watch a comedy . I need something to get my mind off the frightening images I have from the Sixth Sense .
Ok . I'll get ready and leave . I'll see you in about 20 minutes .
Hurry , ok . It's dark out .
Don't worry , nothings going to happen . I'll be there real soon .
Oh , four or five . How much is the rent for this apartment ?
150 a month .
Hello , could I speak to Mr . Wang , please ?
I am sorry . He's out in a meeting now . Could I ask who is calling ?
This is Mr . Smith of XYZ Company . When will he be back ?
He'll be back at about five in the afternoon . Could I take a message ?
Yes , Please tell him I called and ask him to return my call as soon as possible . It's about the PPT contract .
Cartons . Is that okay ?
I'm concerned about the possible jolting , squeezing and collision that may take place when these cases are moved about .
Well , what I can tell you is this . We've got an excellent record on making deliveries to our customers . Besides , all our cartons are lined with shockproof cardboards and are wrapped up with polyethylene sheets . So they're not only shockproof but also dampproof .
In that case , I guess I can rest assured .
Well , I guess you can say that . The safety of packing is something we always pay a lot of attention to . Especially for those fragile commodities , we've got to be extra careful . Otherwise , if the things we don't want to see happened , we would be responsible and that'll cause you a lot of inconvenience , too .
You're right . But wouldn't it be safer to use wooden cases ?
We sure can if you want us to , but the charge will be much higher .
It wouldn't be worth the trouble in that case , would it ? Let's still use cartons .
For what days , madam ?
Leaving on September 5th and returning to New York City on October 9th .
Do you prefer an aisle or a window seat ?
I prefer to sit next to a window .
How would like to pay ?
I have a Master Card .
Wow that ’ s great news ! They ’ re a great couple !
I know ! Anyways I just talked to Alex ’ s best man and he is organizing the bachelor party It ’ s gonna be so much fun ! All the groomsmen are thinking up all the wacky and crazy things we are going to do that night .
You aren ’ t going to a strip club , are you ? I don ’ t want you getting a lap dance from some stripper with the excuse that it ’ s your friends party .
Aw come on ! It ’ s just some innocent fun ! You know how these things are ! We are gonna play drinking games , get him some gag gifts and just have a good time . Nothing too over the top .
Well , I don ’ t know .
Come on ! If one of your friends was getting married I wouldn ’ t mind you going to her bachelorette party !
Good , because my friend Wendy is getting married and I ’ m organizing her party !
Yes . So am I . But what will he do after graduation ? He really needs to go to college .
Well , dear , we can't force him to go to college . It's up to him .
Yes . What about you ?
Yes , I'm very busy , too . Sometimes I work overtime .
Then your salary must be high .
Just so so . But we can travel twice every year .
Is this time one of them ?
Yes , we won't travel again until October .
Well . Let ’ s go swimming .
Don ’ t you think it ’ s a bit cold for that ?
What's up ?
Could you pick up Mrs . David from Ford Company at the Capital Airport ?
Why don't you go ?
I'm supposed to do it , but the general manager called me last night . He said he couldn ’ t come back to Beijing as scheduled , so he asked me to attend the meeting for him .
I see . I'll do it for you .
I'm a student .
Which school are you studying at ?
Do you have any homework today ?
I'll do it later .
Go and do it now .
How did you get wind of the rumor ?
I am not a rumor monger .
I am so glad they called you . It feels like something is really wrong with my stomach !
Does it hurt when I push here ?
It ’ s mostly on my right side . Right here !
Have you been feeling this way for awhile ?
I started feeling kind of sick last night after dinner , but this morning the pain got really bad !
Have you eaten anything unusual lately ?
No , not that I remember .
We are going to take you to an emergency room right now .
I'm looking for a citizen for my wife's birthday .
Oh , we have many kinds.Do you like this design .
Sure , it's easy . First of all , the secret to a successful oral presentation is to keep things simple . People are listening and they usually don't have a long attention spans . Stick to about three or four points , give an overview of the points , then present them one by one , and then summarize at the end . Be straightforward and organized and you're sure to be remembered .
What kind of visuals should I use to support the presentation ? Do you think I should use PowerPoint ?
You should consider the size and interests of your audience . In other words , who is listening , and what do they want to hear ... you can put together a PPT with some graphics and animations that will catch people's attention , but be careful not to go overboard .
I think I can put something together , no problem . But when it comes to tomorrow , I'll just be a bundle of nerves ! How can I get over my fear of speaking in public ?
All set . I've got my makeup , my Cds , and my portable TV set ...
Hello ! We're supposed to be getting back to nature .
Yeah , yeah . Anyway ... I'm packed . Are you ?
I've been packed for a week . All my stuff is in this backpack .
Let me see ... two books ... birdseed ?
That's trail mix !
Yes , reading is my hobby .
What kind of books do you like to read most ?
Many kinds of books . When I was a child in elementary school , I enjoyed reading fables and science fiction . When I became to a teenager at middle school , I was interested in detective mystery stories . Now I like reading romance stories .
Are you in love ?
Why ?
People say only those that are in love like to read romance stories .
I think I am who you are looking for . You have got to be Rubin .
That would be me !
Rubin ! Karen and Mike have spoken about you so often that I feel like I've met you before .
I hope that what they had to say was mostly good !
They only said wonderful things about you . You did a good job of finding me .
Finding the beautiful woman in a red dress next to the fountain wasn't all that hard .
Yes , I guess it was a choice of me or the pigeons !
I was hoping that we could take a walk down the street to my favorite cafe .
So he always sits above the salt when there is a seminar about it .
Right , to be famous to be respectable in some way .
Yes .
Hello , Mr David Richton , this is Min Wang calling from network , i am calling about the reporter position you advertised on the internet .
Oh , yes , Mr Wang , i look at your resume you emailed , very impressive , are you a P . M . ~ meet someone like you , i was thinking of calling you this afternoon , and having a telephone interview .
Don't worry . You'll be fine . First of all , put on your seat belt . Adjust the mirrors .
You don't think I'll need the seat belt , do you ?
Of course not . But it's a good habit to put it on every time you drive .
Just in case , right ?
Well . They may ask you to tell them more about your educational background and your working background .
But they can see my resume . It's all in there .
I know , but sometimes interviewers just want to hear you say it . Then you may be asked for your viewpoint on why you feel you are qualified for the job , give them all your qualifications and how you think they will fit the position you are applying for . Questions like what sort of experience do you have and what are your goals ? are closely related to this .
Ok . What else ?
They may want to know how the company will benefit and why they should hire you ?
I see . What about the salary ?
Hm , they may ask you what kind of salary you have in mind , or simply tell you what the company is offering . I think the latter is more likely for a starting position , especially if you have little experience . And if they are seriously considering hiring you , they will probably want to know when you would be available to start work . And basically , that's about it .
Ok , thanks , David . You ’ Ve helped me a lot .
Everything about them was different , even the theaters .
I'm really interested . Tell me about them .
Well , where I grew up , we saw movies at a drive-in theater in our car with the whole family .
That's cool . I bet you could bring your own food .
We did . On hot days , we'd take a blanket and lay in the back of dad's old pickup to watch the movie .
Why don't we do that anymore ?
Yes , dad ?
Do you have life insurance ?
Well , no . It just seemed like another bill we ’ d have to pay .
You have children now . What if something , God forbid , happens to you ?
That ’ s true . Well , how much do you think I should get ?
Yes , I do .
Could you lend me one ?
OK . Here you are .
Thanks . It's rather cold this morning , wouldn't you say ?
You're right .
Do you know the news ?
Which one ?
Brazil wins the World Cup .
We'd better have a heart-to-heart talk with him .
But we cannot talk like elders .
Not bad . I ’ m proficient in both written and spoken English .
Could you tell me something about your English education ?
I studied English in junior and senior high school . And in college , I took English conversation lessons . They were given by foreign tutors .
Have you passed College English Test Band 4 or Band 6 ?
Band 6 .
Great . Can you file in English ?
I ’ m afraid I can ’ t , but I'd be glad to learn .
You would be using a lot of English in this job . Can you manage English conversation ?
Yes , I think I can . I often talk to foreigners at English corner held twice a week at my college . They say my English is pretty good .
Excellent . How is your English ability in reading and writing ?
I have been attending an evening course in English writing for 2 years and I often read novels , magazines and newspapers in English .
The Spur .
What was the score ?
Ok , you name the day .
How about the second of March ?
What day is that ?
It's Friday .
I think I'm going to eat a piece of fruit .
What kind do you like ?
I really like apples and grapes .
What kind of apples do you like ?
I love green apples .
I don't like green apples .
Really ? Why not ?
Green apples are too sour for me .
So , you like red apples better ?
Yeah , I love red apples .
Sounds interesting , I haven't gone boating for some time now , and what time ?
How about tomorrow afternoon ?
Sure . Where shall I meet you ?
At the gate of the park .
Great . I look forward to meeting you .
See you then .
I don't care what the best part is . Whatever you say won't change my mind . I'm not buying anything !
That stamp you've been looking for is for sale .
The 1879 Large Dragon ? Are you serious ? How much ?
Awful . It was a complete waste of time .
Why ? What was it about ?
It was about a married couple . They had to live with the wife's mother , because they didn't have enough money to buy a house of their own .
A lot of young people have to do that .
Yes . but the husband had to work overtime three times a week , so he was always tired .
lt sounds like the story of my life .
Yes , it does , doesn't it ? But this man was always over-tired , and he couldn't sleep.So he used to take two sleeping pill every night .
I take sleeping pills sometimes .
Yes , but not two every night . Anyway , the strain was too much for him . He had nervous breakdown and had to go to hospital .
It sounds a very depressing film .
Not really . His wife was able to find a good job as an interpreter , because she could speak French and German fluently . After a few months ' work , she had a better job than her husband . So in the end ,
I hope we can make great progress in this new semester .
Hope so .
I hear we ’ ll have a new English teacher this semester .
Really ? I hope we will do much better under her guidance .
Hi , Bill . I ’ d like to take the apartment I looked at yesterday .
All right .
So , what do we do now ?
This is the lease . You should read the lease very carefully before you sign it because it describes your legal rights and responsibilities as a tenant . The lease also describes our rights and responsibilities as landlords .
Okay . ( Reads the lease ) So , according to the lease , I ’ ll deposit one month ’ s rent as a security deposit , and I have to pay the first month ’ s rent in advance . I understand that I ’ ll get the security deposit back when I move out if the apartment does not need any costly repairs .
Yes . If you do not damage the apartment , you will get your security deposit back when you move out .
Can I pay you by check ?
Sure . A check will be fine .
Is there a laundry room in the basement ?
Yes .
Why ? it doesn't make sense . If we do the floors first , and then paint the walls , we will get paint all over our new floor .
Hmm Maybe you're right . But I can't stand all this green carpet here . And besides , I know how to paint . I will just cover everything with drop cloth . I won't get anything on the floor .
Are you sure ?
Yes , I'm sure I've done a lot of house painting in my life . And my mother was very picky . If I got even a tiny drop of paint on her furniture , she would get furious . So I learned to be very careful .
Alright . Then maybe we can do the floor first . These wood floors under this carpet are beautiful . And me too — — I can't wait to get all this old carpet out of here . But how can we get it out ? Do we have to hire someone ?
Absolutely not . We can remove the carpet ourselves . Carpet is held down with carpet nails . You just need to pull it hard and it will come up .
Great . Then , after we remove the carpet , we need to redo all the wood floors . Right ?
Yes . But we should hire someone for that . That will probably be expensive . And it has to be done right .
And then , after the floors are done , we can start to move our furniture in .
Yes , it will take about four hours . We can leave about noon and get there by supper time .
Let me help pay for gas .
All right . There will be three of us going so we will each pay a third .
What other expenses will we have ?
sure , what is it ?
I was just wondering if many Chinese people take their leftover food home from a restaurant .
in most cities in China , doggie bags are quite uncommon .
what happen to all the leftover food ?
it usually goes to the dump .
that seems like an awful waste ! Why don't people order fewer dishes so that they don't have to throw so much away at the end of the meal ?
ordering a lot of food at restaurants is just a tradition in China . You know , in the past , people could not afford to eat out like they can today .
I guess that makes sense . I just think it would make more sense to take the leftovers home .
well , if you want , you can take the leftovers home .
no , that's OK . You know what they say when in Rome ...
I was impressed that you tried the pig's feet . I heard that many foreigners don't like to eat them .
many people in my generation don't eat pig's feet , but my parents grew up eating them , so I think they are OK .
did you like them ? You could take the last one home with you .
I ’ m worrying about the children . After all this is the first time they have been out without us .
Don ’ t worry . They are grown-ups .
Yes . When do you want it ?
Next Today . By the way , is there a closed circuit TV ?
Yes , sir .
What about laundry ?
Bad . My nose keeps running . And my forehead is burning .
You said you never went to hospital .
I will get better soon .
The good thing is you don't need to go to school .
Yeah , I love that , no class , no homework , and no exams .
And your Mom and Dad will buy you anything you ask for .
Haha , I just got the Ultraman costume . My Dad bought it .
I really envy you , Danny .
Come on , I got numerous shots for that . You have no idea what I've been through with the needles .
Your sister said you fainted three times during the injection .
May told you ? Oh , May , she's such a tattletale .
No matter what , you are still my hero , Daniel .
Tom , promise me to keep this a secret , will you ?
OK , I promise . You promise you will be well soon ?
English is my favorite .
No wonder your English is so good .
Sure , which beach are we going to ?
I wanted to go to Malibu beach .
I like Santa Monica .
The water there looks so dirty .
I just like the pier they have at Santa Monica .
I like the pier too , because it's beautiful at night .
Is Malibu beach nice ?
It's a lot nicer , and I really like it better .
So you want to go to Malibu ?
If that's okay with you .
hi . It was awful . I think I put forward some great ideas , but none of them were accepted .
I ’ m surprised to hear that . I thought you had some very good suggestions .
so did i . I ran the ideas by a few people before the meeting and their ideas seemed to have the supports of some people .
so what happened in the meeting ?
one or two people didn ’ t take to my ideas very well . That was to be expected . The worst thing was that the people who said the idea were good before the meeting didn ’ t support me during the meeting .
I wonder why not . We could always revise the suggestions , to take into account any objections .
that ’ s good advice , but I ’ m not confident that even revised proposals will be accepted .
may I make a suggestion ?
sure . I ’ m open to any reasonable suggestions .
Is there a chance you could contact the client confidentially and see what they think ? If they like your ideas , perhaps they could put them forward as their own proposals . You won ’ t get credit for ide
I ’ m not sure that ’ s a good idea .
the professor is a bit boring today . You need something to perk yourself up . How about a coffee ?
I don't really like coffee , to be honest . It's too bitter for me .
well , you need something to wake you up . How about a soda ?
most some drinks have too much sugar in them .
the diet sodas don't have any caffeic in them , which one would you like ?
I like diet sprite . Does that have any caffeine in it ?
unfortunately , it doesn't . how about some diet coke ?
I don't care for coke . I heard that coke was first used as a medicine and I don't like medicine . What else has caffeine ?
maybe you should try a cappuccino or a latte ; they taste much better than plain brewed coffee .
maybe . How about a mochaccino ? Are they any good ?
you'll love that . It's just a shot of espresso beans mixed with steam milk and some chocolate syrup .
that's perfect ! Would you like one , too ? My treat .
So I've heard . That's why I'm having such a great time .
If I hadn't married an Italian man , I probably wouldn't be pregnant so often . And maybe I could raise pigs instead of bambinos !
Huh ? Um ... well , it's nice to see that some people still have big families .
How do you do ?
I'm coming for the job you've advertised in yesterday's newspaper .
OK . What's your working experience ?
I have worked for IBM for three years .
How do your experiences benefit our company ?
I know the marketing from top to bottom and I can develop a new market for you .
Are you aware of the aspects of this position and do you feel you are qualified ?
Yes , I understand my qualification and your needs by researching your company .
If you enter this company , what section would you like to work in ?
If possible , I'd like to be positioned in the International Trade Department .
Then , what starting salary do you expect ?
Elvin Dixon . Who are you ?
I'm Mary . I want to say I really admire the software you're designed .
Easy stuff . But thanks . And the admiration is mutual .
It is ?
You're selling invoking subscriptions like nobody's business . And we don't even have a working demo yet .
A trip to the beach would be fun . How is the weather going to be ?
The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend .
So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach ?
It sounds like it will be .
I really hope it doesn't get cold .
That would ruin things , I want to go so badly .
The weather in California is unpredictable , so you never know .
That is true . The weather is constantly changing .
It would be nice if the weather would never change .
That would be great , then we could plan things sooner .
Yeah , that's right , around five nine five ten .
Weight ?
I'm not sure.Medium , I suppose.Maybe a little on the heavy side .
Any karks on his face ?
No , I don't think so .
Glasses ?
No .
what about his hair ?
Black or dark brown .
Long or short ? Straight ? Curly ?
Straight , I think , and about average length .
Boy , this surely doesn't help us much.It could be anybody.How about his cloth ? What was he wearing .
Well , he had a Jacked or a Plage shirt . You know the kind of number jack wear .
Ok , now we are getting some where.Pants ?
Dark , maybe dark blue maybe black . I'm not sure .

Yes . I'm looking for an apartment , I'd like two bedrooms .
All right . Have a seat , please . Let me ask you a few questions . First of all , may I have your name , please ?
My name's Donald Eakins .
How do you spell your last name , Mr.Eakins .
It's E-A-K-I-N-S .
E-A-K-I-N-S.First name , Donald . And what's your present address , Mr.Eakins ?
It's 1446 Pine Street .
1446 Pine . That's in San Francisco , isn't it ?
Teachers are just directors who give scope to the students ' initiative and creativeness , instead of taking their rights away from speaking .
What did you do to put it into practice ?
Forget it ! If you think I ’ d ever set foot that inferior restaurant again , you gotta be nuts . Last time I ate that food , almost vomited . The service in there is terrible . It was the first time I ever stiffed a waiter
Yeah , not seeing a single person anywhere informed me . Hey ! How about that one over there ?
Oh , give me a break ! That place is too lavish for us .
Easy . It ’ s on me .
So , why don ’ t you ?
I have no idea how to use the ATM .
What do you mean ?
This will be my first time using an ATM .
I can help you with that .
Explain to me how to use it .
Just put your card into the machine .
Now what do I do ?
Then you need to type in your PIN .
Now what ?
I'm looking for some earrings for my wife as a wedding anniversary gift .
You've come to the right store . We've got a beautiful and wide selection of earrings for you to choose from .
I saw a pair of earrings outside your window . Can you show them to me ?
Do you mean the exquisite pearl earrings ?
Exactly . How much do you want for them ?
They're only three thousand yuan .
What is this setting made of ?
Well , it's specially made of a platinum alloy , sir , and the lustre will never fade out .
I'II take them . Please wrap them up tor me and give me the receipt .
Not at all .
If I have time , I will come again .
You are welcome at any time .
Thank you for your hospitality . I hope I didn ’ t cause you too much trouble during my stay .
You are most welcome .
I ’ m afraid I have to go now . The plane will take off soon .
How about a movie ? We haven't done that for a while .
A movie ? Sure . Do you know what's on right now ?
No . Why don't you check out the newspaper ?
Can we have two a joining double room , sir ?
Have you made a reservation ladies ?
I ’ m afraid not .
One moment , please . I have to check if there are room available . I ’ m sorry ladies . We have only two double room available , but they are on different floors . Would you mind that ?
We prefer they are on same floor because we have a problem check late that night .
May I suggest family sweet ? You all just have a consolation .
what ’ s it like ?
It ’ s a big room with a king - size double bed and two single beds . You ’ Ve get also an roller-wheels .
That ’ s great . How much is it ?
2000 Hongkong dollars per night plus ten percent service charge and five percent government tax .
That ’ s fine .
But , ladies , the room ’ s not yet ready . It will be delay about half an hour . Perhaps you can fill the registration form first . And rest at the lobby for a while . We ’ ll let you know when the room ‘ s ready .
Alright . thanks .
Ladies , Hotel policy requires one nine of room charge as deposit .
Do you take traveller ’ s check ?
What--is tomorrow night something special ?
It's Friday . We should go party .
I don't need to drink every weekend . I could be happy just staying home , you know .
Okay . Stay home Sunday . But Friday we should go out dancing .
Do you feel like dancing ?
Yes ? Why not ?
Alright.At least that's better than sitting in a bar with your alcoholic friends .
They aren't alcoholic !
No , maybe they're not . But they're close .
So where should we go ?
Let's go to the Latin Club . I think they will have a Brazilian band there this weekend . Maybe it's Friday night .
You always want to go to the Latin Club . I don't know those dance steps . I'd rather go to the New Bar .
The New Bar is all techno music on Friday night.You really want to dance to that ?
It's not all techno music . It's not a special techno night .
No . But they play techno all the time . It drives me crazy after forty minutes.And anyhow , if we go to the Latin Club you could actually learn some Latin dance steps.At the New Bar you'll just shake yourself around for an hour.And then you'll get sick of stand you'll want to go get drunk somewhere where the drinks are cheaper . I know you .
It's fine with me if we go to the Latin Club . I like Latin Music.The only thing I never want to do again is listen to country rock.What was that bar called ?
Oh . You mean Jerry's , over on the east side.That wasn't my idea going there .
No . It was that friend of yours , Melissa.Her and all her lousy country music Cds . Yecch !
It's true . I would never go there again either.Country music is a nightmare . So is it the Latin Club ?
Yes . You have to teach me the samba , and the tango , and whatever else they do .
Well , it seems you'll have to learn some Spanish too , won't you ?
There's a service called ' A friend in New York ' . It's a personal tour guide service .
That's interesting . What does it do ?
You give them your information by answering a questionnaire and they will create a perfect trip for you according to your budget .
Good . Where can I get the questionnaire ?
Could I see your ID , please , sir ?
Of course ! Let me take it out of my wallet .
Thank you , sir . Now , do you have a credit card , sir ?
Yes , of course . Is American Express okay ?
I'm sorry , sir . Only VISA or MasterCard .
In that case , here's my VISA .
Thank you . Your room number is 507 , queen bed , nonsmoking . Is that agreeable to you , sir ?
Yes , I'm easy to please .
It's in aisle A .
Do you know what produce is on sale ?
C :: I ’ d like to have this roll of film developed .
S :: What size prints would you like ?
C :: Four by six will do .
Sure . What's the matter with you ?
The exam ! The terrible exam ! I'm not ready yet . Can you tell me how to get good marks ?
Don't be so nervous ! Relax ! First , sleep early at night . Second , study two hours a day after school . Third , don't tire yourself out , but don't be lazy . Will that help ?
I need some stamps .
What kind of stamps do you want ?
How much do I need for this letter ?
I must weigh it .
How much ? Is it overweight ?
It is 5 grams overweight . Do you want to send it as an ordinary or registered letter ?
How much is it , then ?
Registration plus overweight , 7 yuan in all .
I ’ m playing with my toys , Dad .
Anything's all right with me . I'm not particular about soups .
Yes , it is . May I help you ?
Yes , are advance tickets for ' Nut croakers ' still available ?
What date , sir ?
October 16th .
Let me see . Yes , we still have some tickets left . Which performance ?
7:30 p . m . performance , please .
OK , we have tickets at 100 yuan and 50 yuan .
I'd like to reserve two seats at 100 yuan , please .
All right . May I have you name , please ?
Du Kun .
When would you like to collect the tickets ?
Tomorrow .
We can hold them until one day before the show .
How do we cancel , just in case ?
Just telephone us , and let us know in advance . We don't charge for cancellation .
All right , thank you very much . Good bye .
Uh , yes .
Do you go to work by train every day ?
Yes . I commute five days a week by train .
And would you mind telling us what you think of the rail service ?
It ’ s really very good .
Why do you say that ?
Well , trains are frequent and come on time .
Which train do you catch in the evening ?
I usually take the 5 thirty home .
And can you get a seat ?
No , I usually have to stand .
Would you agree that the service is fast ?
I'm not sure . I was thinking of making a vegetable .
What kind of vegetable are you thinking about making ?
Do you know what kind of vegetable you want to eat ?
Why don't you make some corn ?
How would you like the corn ?
I don't understand what you mean .
Do you want it boiled , grilled , or microwaved ?
Why don't you grill it ?
That's how you want it ?
Yeah , that sounds delicious .
Yes . I feel refreshed .
How long will we dock ?
In half an hour . The surface of the lake is calm .
Yes , they are our main export bases of tools with the advantage of having good production experience and long historical record . All their products enjoy high prestige in the world market .
That's very good . But I have little knowledge about the packing of your pliers . I just want to know the details about that .
Ok , I'll show you how the packing is like . We have a showroom on the ground floor . Let's go downstairs and have a look .
Sure .
These are the various kinds of packing for pliers . Normally , we have three types of packing
Oh , the packing looks very nice .
The skin packing is the most advanced packing for this product in the world market . It catches the eyes and can help push sales .
Good , what about the export packing ?
Well , they are packed in boxes of two dozens each , 100 boxes to a wooden case .
Is the wooden case strong enough for transportation ? You see , 100 boxes of pliers are very heavy . It's about 2,400 kilograms .
You can rest assured of that . So far , no customers have complained about our outer packing .
I'm glad to hear that . By the way , do you accept neutral packing ?
Yes , we can pack the goods according to your instructions .
Very good . Ok , Mr . Brown , I'm now totally satisfied with your packing . You can execute our first order now , and I will open the L / C immediately after I return to Taipei .
we ’ re glad that you ’ re here . Would you like a tour of the house ?
that ’ d be great , but could I have a cup of tea first ?
sure , I ’ ll just go put the kettle on . Why don ’ t you have a seat on the sofa and I ’ ll go take care of things in the kitchen .
that would be lovely , thanks .
do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
I ’ ll take a little milk , but no sugar , please . Make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .
ok . What do you think about our living room ?
well , I do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table , but I don ’ t really care for curtains . Did you get them at a yard sale ? They look ancient .
my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
oh dear . Well , I suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? It seems a bit dusty in here .
your daughter usually does the dusting , and I do the vacuuming .
I see . Well , I can help with the chores while I ’ m here . You two could probably use my help .
You have a warrant out for your arrest .
I don't have a warrant .
My computer shows that you have a bench warrant .
I don't know what a bench warrant is .
You apparently missed a court appearance .
I was never told to go to court .
There's nothing I can do about that .
This isn't fair .
That's life .
What about my rights ?
It ’ s nice to meet you ! Guess we ’ ll be working together .
Yes , she ’ ll be working closely with you on the marketing end of things .
Yes , what do you have for appetizer ?
We have caviar , foiegras , lox , cold beef , sour cucumber ...
Well , please bring me the cold beef .
Just get out of my face , would you ?
Chill out ! What's eating you , anyway ?
Sorry . I'm just that I think I blew the final and now my parents are going to get all bent out of shape . I like totally drew a blank on everything !
Well , now you're really going to freak out when I tell you who aced it ... what's-her-face ... the one who always kisses up to the teacher .
Jennifer Davies ? Give me a break ! I can't stand her . She's such a dweeb ! How could she possibly ace it when she keeps cutting class all the time ?
She's the teacher's pet , that's why . Besides , he's so laid back he lets her get away with it . She just really rubs me the wrong way . And you know what ? I think she's got the hots for him , too .
Get out of here !
I'm dead serious . Yesterday , before class starts , she walks up to Mr - Edward's desk and goes , ‘ Good morning , Jim . ’
An old one .
I know it's old , but what make is it ?
It's a Chevrolet . Why do you ask ? You going into the car business ?
Nothing like that . My cousin is going to take a job overseas and he can't take his car with him , so he's going to sell it - cheap . It's practically new .
well I have been thinking about getting a newer car . I can't afford a brand new one .
Would you like to look at my cousin's car ?
Is it a four-door or a two-door ?
It's a coupe with a vinyl roof .
Does it have automatic transmission ? .
Yes , and it also has power steering , power brakes , and air conditioning .
I sure did .
Did you see everything ?
I was in the bank at the time .
What exactly did you see ?
I saw the guy come in with a gun .
Did you get a good look at his face ?
He was wearing a mask .
Was anyone else with him ?
He came in alone .
Could you come to the station for more questioning ?
Nothing much . What are you up to ?
I was just concerned about Sam . He hasn't been himself lately .
He took the civil service exam and failed .
That sucks . He must feel depressed .
Yeah . He's been sitting in his room everyday for the last 4 days .
Why don't we take him out ? We can try to take his mind off of it . In the least show him that we're there for him .
That's a great idea . Why don't you call him . I already talked to him a couple of times and it might be good for him to hear from somebody else .
Ok . I'll call you back after I'm done .
Whenever you're ready to check out , I'll be ready , sir .
Great ! As you know however , the day in New York has hardly begun .
You're right . It's only 9
Therefore , I think I'll explore New York some more . But I need to store my bags .
Sir , our storage facility is merely $ 5 an hour . You also need to leave a deposit .
My luggage isn't enough of a deposit ?
Unfortunately , it isn't . VISA or MasterCard will suffice , though .
Well , then . Let me put on my thinking cap for a moment .
Yes , please . I'd like the steak and mushrooms .
How would you like your steak , rare , medium , or well-done ?
I'd like it well done , please .
What kind of potatoes would like to go with that , mushed , boiled , or baked ?
I think i have bake potatoes.And i now have a ice tea with lemon on the side , please .
Good , and would you care for soup or salad to start with ?
I'd like cream onion soup please .
Will you have desert to be , madam ?
I want to skip desert.That all , thank you .
What seems to be the problem ?
I have a rash that I need a doctor to look at .
Do you have a fever with that rash ?
No , it just itches a lot .
I have openings on Tuesday or Wednesday . Which would be best for you ?
I need an appointment on Tuesday .
Fine , I am putting you down for 9
I would like to see Dr . Jones .
No more today , honey .
Alright , Mom . Should I turn off the TV right now ?
Yes , honey . Go to your room , and take out your book . It's your reading time now .
Mom , where is the remote ? I can't find it .
I went a global warming rally in London . It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment .
do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ?
it might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening .
like what ?
well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start .
what else can we do to protect the environment ?
if you do have to drive , you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . Also , your home should use sources of renewable energy .
how about recycling ? Does that actually help ?
yes . You should take your glass , paper , plastic , cardboard , and tin cans to a recycling center .
what do you think is the biggest worry for our future ?
I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone .
I had no idea you were such as environmentalist before !
I'd be glad to .
I'm afraid that I don't have a credit history . I just came to this country .
Do you have an account with this bank ?
I'm afraid not .
In that case I highly recommend you apply for a savings and checking account also . That would help with your credit card application .
What is the interest rate on your card ?
The annual charge rate is 9.5 % .
That's very expensive !
Not really . The credit card is a revolving account . You only pay interest on what you owe .
How does the bank bill its customers for credit card charges ?
You will receive a monthly statement with each expenditure itemized .
Does the card provide any other benefits ?
Gas and water are included .
Do I have to pay for electricity myself ?
There is a fire in your building . You need to evacuate immediately .
What ? A fire ? Oh , my God ! What shall I do ? Please get me out of here !
Don't panic ! We'll help you get out of the building safely .
I can smell smoke !
Please follow my instructions . Use a wet towel to cover your mouth and nose . Walk quietly to th nearest emergency exit . Now go get the wet towel .
OK .
Come with me .
Sir , I need to go back to get my jewelry box .
Don't take your personal belongings . We need to get out of the building now !
Gosh ! I can see the flames !
No , there's a definite difference . You know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system . Then there's the CEO — the chief executive officer . He's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . It's too dangerous . That's the reason for a Board of Directors . The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . They could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased .
How many people are on the board of directors ?
We've a country house .
That's nice .
Join us , will you ?
I strongly recommend it . As an international enterprise , it produces high quality household appliances .
Is there a warranty ?
Yes , all their products have warranties .
How long is it ?
The fridges is covered by a one-year warranty .
Which model is the best seller of this year ?
This one . How do you like it ?
It's too big for me . Could you recommend something else ?
Yes , they notify me to work next week .
Where on earth will you work in ?
It is a pretty big mechanical company . I am assigned to work in the assembly shop .
How long will you work a day ?
My working hours aren ’ t fixed , sometimes I do the day shift , sometimes the night shift . In all , about 8 hours .
That ’ s rather hard .
But it matches my major .
How will you get your pay ?
My wage depends on production results .
What sort of welfare facilities does your company provide ?
The company provides labor insurance for all employees , as well as fine retirement policy .
Is there a union ?
There is the company union , but it really shares the same aims as the management .
So you must consider dearly before you go to work .
Hello , Miao Ping . It's that time again ; I want to convert my salary . You know , it's so annoying . I wish my company could just pay me in RIB .
Haha ! I actually think that many locals would disagree with you ; they are all dying to be paid in US dollars .
Yes , I guess you are right . So , do you need my passport ?
Thanks , Mr Janus . Of course I trust you , but regulations are regulations .
Here you go .
Yeah . He really does let me down .
But that should not be the reason for you to lose heart .
Would you like to have a taste of Moutan ?
That's great ! What comes along with Moutan ?
Yes , you con order some typical Chinese dishes . For example , Roast Beijing Duck .
It sounds good .
Yes , it is the best of our hotel .
Really ? Let me have a try .
Yeah . Complete with nice of you .
How many windows are there in the apartment ?
Mm , let me see . I think there are 2 in the bedroom , and 1 each in the living room and kitchen .
It ’ s just what I want . I think I am ready to sign .
I call the landlord right now .
Before you send the lease , do you have any questions ?
Yes , does the renting include utilities ?
It includes everything except cable TV , and telephone .
How much is the cable ?
It usually comes out about $ 40 a month .
Also , are they allowing the apartment ?
No , I am afraid the apartment isn ’ t permitted .
I see . Do you love pets ?
What exactly is wrong with the plumbing ?
The toilet flushes really slowly .
Are there any problems with the plumbing in the kitchen ?
Both the kitchen and the bathroom plumbing are messed up .
How long have you had these problems ?
It has been going on for a while , but just started to get worse this morning .
I will send someone out to take a look at the problem . Will you be home this afternoon ?
Yes , I will be home this afternoon .
It's hard to say ! But it seems that a lot of wars nowadays are civil wars . People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country .
Yeah , several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . It seems they will never end .
How do you think they could be ended ?
I don't think that there is any easy way .
I think one better way to stop it is to cut off their financial support .
Thank you for inviting me .
What would you like to drink ?
It's a special green tea named Longing Tea from Zhejiang province .
What's special about it except its pleasant smell ?
You can see that it keeps the original color of the tea leaves very well .
They must have some special methods to do this during the process .
Probably . I love green tea . It's one of my daily necessities .
Then , do you have “ tea time ” every day ? I mean , do you drink tea at a settled time ?
Not really . But I really love to have after-meal tea .
What's the advantage about tea ?
There are a lot of them . In hot or warm days , tea helps to dispel the heat and brings on an instant cool with a feeling of relaxation . Moreover , the tea leaves contain a number of chemicals which are good for people's health .
Does that mean the stronger the better ?
No . Constant drinking of over-strong tea would do harm to people's health . So don't make your tea too strong .
Got it . What's the proper time for tea ?
It's fine for most time of the day . But don't have tea before bedtime .
Why ?
part-timer ? Is that a new buzzword ?
oh , it ’ s pretty popular among my classmates these days . So are you ?
sure , I have a part-time job as a bartender .
cool ! It must be amazing to work at a bar !
yeah , but I ’ m not there for fun . I have to remain professional and if I get distracted , the manager would be pretty upset .
that ’ s true . I ’ m wondering did you learn anything from the job ?
of course . There ’ s always much to learn . I got to know more about the real world .
you mean you got working experience , right ?
not just working experience . I would say the biggest lesson I learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life .
it must be very demanding .
sometimes it is . But after working for a few weeks , it ’ s easy to figure out .
really ? It sounds interesting .
maybe you can come to the bar one day and I ’ ll show you around .
Don't you want to go to the visiting hours ? This sheet says they are tonight .
I just can't right now . Everyone will be talking about Taylor and ...
... and maybe that's what we both need .
I need to come to grips with his death first . And I also need to prepare a eulogy in case I'm asked to speak tomorrow .
$ 60 .
I am sure you can do better than that .
Sorry , sir . It's the sale price .
Well , what about $ 70 with a scarf ?
Hello , Helen , have you heard the news ? There ’ s been a horrible accident .
Oh , no ! What happened ?
Hilda Harris husband , Henry had an accident on his way home from work .
How awful ! Was he hurt ?
Yes . He was taken to the hospital in an ambulance .
How did it happen ?
His car was hit by an express train . It happened at the crossing just behind his house .
How horrible !
He ’ s having an operation in the hospital now . Poor Hilda ! You can imagine how unhappy she is .
I hope he ’ ll be all right .
I'm going to work .
What time will you be home ?
Yeah , hold on a second . I ’ Ve got it in my office . Here it is . 553-2213 .
553-2213 . Great , thanks .
Hello , Miao Ping , I'm here to chat with you about Corporate Agreement Savings . What can you tell me ?
Well , Corporate Agreement Savings will be based on the Agreement Deposit Contract signed by the customer and the bank together . So , this contract decides the terms and the line of basic deposit withheld while settling the account . So , if we look within the line of basic deposit , the interest should be counted at the rate of Current Deposit on the day of settlement or withdrawal .
What if I exceed ?
If it goes beyond the basic deposit , the agreement will be settled at the rate agreement savings which has been determined by the People's Bank of China on the day you wish to settle or withdraw .
It ’ s because of my son . Dick keeps getting on my nerves
Dick ? How come ? He used to be as meek as a lamb .
Yes , he used to be . But now he ’ s drifting off track .
Todd , good to hear from you !
I just wanted to tell you what a great time I had with you at the movies last week .
Me too , Todd ! Thanks for suggesting that great movie .
I also enjoyed it and was wondering if you would like to go for a hike in the mountains with me on Saturday .
I would love to join you on a hike . Could I maybe bring a picnic lunch for us to eat on the trail ?
Sure Linda , that's a great suggestion .
Fine then , what time are we going to leave ?
I was thinking maybe 9 o'clock or so , so that we could get started before the heat gets too bad .
Are you aware that you drove through a red light ?
I ran a red light ?
Yes , you did .
I apologize , but I didn't realize that I did .
Weren't you taught that yellow means slow down , not speed up ?
I did learn that .
So , then why did you speed up ?
I don't know what to tell you .
I'm going to have to write you a ticket .
I understand .
$ 70 , madam .
Here you are . Can you put the bread in a separate bag ?
I'm not sure.You look familiar .
You're Mr.Stevenson , right ?
Well , your insurance covers sufficient money to replace it . So you don ’ t need to worry .
I don ’ t think I could afford that kind of car again . I think I ’ ll have to choose something that is not as hard to replace .
Since you are not the one who caused the accident , your insurance cost should be the same .
What will happen if I chose a smaller car ? Would the payments be the same ?
If you got a smaller car , the cost should be a little less depending on the model , age , and size . Would you still want full coverage ?
Well . I am afraid you have made a mistake . It's not the dish I ordered .
Let me see , I am sorry . It's for table 11 .
An old book Death on the Nile.Have you read it ?
Not yet , but I saw the movie.Could I borrow it when you finish reading ?
No , I don't . I left it home .
Sorry , but we can't do anything without the receipt . Come back with it .
I didn't know . I'll go to get it . How late will you be open ?
Thank you for saying so . I don ’ t know , probably because I like sharing my experience and knowledge with them . I think this kind of communication helps to improve our work efficiency and also helps to get along with colleagues .
Sharing knowledge can be very settled and some second stances . People may think you are telling them how to do their work . If they take it personally , they feel angry at you and even become reluctant to support you at work .
That is true . Some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way . For example , it is not sensible at all to arguing with the others or correcting someone in front of other people . To show your friendliness and willingness to share is much more important than to show off .
You are quite right . Thank you for sharing your experience with me . I learned a lot .
I like it . But how did you know about my new job ? I wanted to surprise you .
I just heard through the grapevine something about you landing a job with some travel agency down town . You can still fill me in on tile details .
Well , two weeks ago I got a tip about a possible job opening at Ace Travel Agency over on Franklin Avenue .
Sure , I think I know the place .
Well , anyway , I made a beeline over to their office , had an interview with the manager , and was told to start work the next day .
That ’ s really great , jill . So , what do you do there exactly ?
Right now I ’ m basically just a secretary , but if I ’ m given the chance , I want to become a travel agent there .
Don ’ t tell me your ’ re already bucking for a promotion .
No , of course not . I ’ Ve got a lot to learn yet . In the meantime , I just want to be a good secretary and not step on anyone ’ s toes .
Yes . I'd like to open an account that enables me to draw money easily .
Well , in that case , I think a checking account may be more convenient for you . However , there's a service charge .
How much is the service charge ?
One percent .
Sounds reasonable . Will 300 dollars be enough for a minimal deposit ?
More than enough . Please fill in this form .
Anything else ?
Glad to tell you . The price of CPU is 300 dollars .
It's rather too high . If you can make it cheaper , we will be able to place large orders continuously .
If you order a large amount , we can give you a discount .
Well , can you explain it to me ?
The price of CPU is 260 dollars above 1,000 Units .
Can you reduce more ?
I'm sorry , but to be frank , considering exploiting the market in your country , we have already supplied you at very low preferential price .
In that case , we have to stop ordering if a reduction can't be made . Please reconsider .
It is so hard to deal with .
If you can give us a more reduction , We'd be able to give you an order on the spot .
My father failed in business .
Oh , that's really tough .
Maybe it is the most difficult period of my family have experienced .
I can understand . By the way , is there anyway I can help ?
No , not now . I have found a part-time job.So perhaps I can help my family to come over the difficulties .
Oh , that's so great , bless you ! if you need me , I'll always be there .
Say it .
As you know , we should work out cautious and detailed plan for our promotion , so as to guide our company to be successful in the new product , L-series .
That's right . And in my opinion , to push the sale of the new products is not an easy task .
I know that . I need to discuss this with Arden . And in his opinion , we should widen the scope of our ads , so newspaper and Internet should be adopted in this campaign .
Could you put it in detail ?
Well . We plan to contact www . on-line advertising . com.cn and Shanghai Morning Newspaper to discuss the advertisement schedule .
I think the idea is very good . In the promotion campaign , two or more media are used together , so as to draw customers ' attention and keep hold their attention to larger extent .
What kind of media do you recommend ?
I think TV is also an effective media , as long as our company is willing to spend more money on it .
Well . Arden just mentioned the paper and the on-sales . And I can talk about TV with him later , because TV promotion gets more and more popular among consumers .
Are you sick ?
No . The teacher is dragging the chalk over the blackboard . It set my teeth on edge .
Oh , hi , Mary , what can I do for you ?
I was wondering when trash collection day was .
It ’ s on Tuesdays and Fridays .
Great .
You could save a couple of dollars by taking it to the dump yourself , though .
Oh , o . k . Where ’ s that ?
It ’ s at the corner of that street .
Thanks . Who do I call for trash collection ?
Just leave the stuff by the curb . The company ’ ll send a guy out next month to give you the bill .
All right . Thanks a lot .
Hi , Jimmy , good morning .
I regret to tell you that the position of Sales Manager has gone to another person .
I see .
We really believe that you are a highly qualified person . But the other candidate has several years of related experiences .
Maybe that is true . But I am a fast learner and I am willing to work overtime , and I do not mind a lot of business travel .
We surely believe you .
Can't you give me another chance and reconsider your decision ?
I am afraid we are sticking to our choice .
Possibly you are now . But in case you will change your mind , please let me know .
Yes , I am studying in Eastern Asian language department .
What are you major in ?
I major in Japanese .
What do you think of the literature course .
Easy for you to say . My bottom still stings .
It might be sore for a while . You'll be OK . Now let's go home and rest .
Can't we go to McDonald's first ?
No , sweetie . I'll make you some tomato soup and rice .
No , thanks .
And vegetables with porridge .
Blah ... What's that ?
You do ?
Look , maybe I shouldn't tell you this , but I'v going over to WebTracker , too .
No way ! That's great ! Then we'll still be together !
Actually , I'm already working for WebTracker . Vince never wanted to give me what I was worth , so I figured , what the heck .
No kidding ! I can't believe this . You devil !
Oh , thank you so much .
Really , it was nothing .
I really appreciated it .
I was happy to help .
It was so kind of you .
Don ’ t mention it .
I ’ m glad to hear that .
How much are you asking ?
You will have to pay $ 1050 every month .
I can ’ t afford that .
What can you afford ?
I was thinking $ 800 a month .
I ’ ll need you to pay more than that .
How much more ?
How does $ 900 every month sound to you ?
I can live with that .
Sure , company rules are not very strict at this point .
Thank you for telling me that .
But remind you , there are some forbidden activities .
What are they ? I ’ ll be careful .
Don ’ t use office phones for personal matters .
I got it .
Never ever come to work drunk , also smoking in the office is not allowed .
You are the leading company in the computer industry .
Why do you think so ?
First , your overwhelming share in the world market . Second , your superiority in sales and profits in addition to the amount of capital and the number of employees . Third , the diversity in your production line is second to none .
In what business are you most interested in this organization ?
Wow ! Sure !
I must confess I have an ulterior motive for asking you to lunch .
Oh ... that's OK ... as long as you're buying !
I really want to pick your brain about something I've been thinking a lot about .
I'd love to help if I can .
Well , as you know , I have a Bachelor's degree in English literature and that's served me well so far , but I've always wanted to do some post-graduate work ... maybe even get a Doctorate !
Wow ! Just the idea of going back to school fills my head with pain .
But you have a Master's degree ... hasn't that helped your career ?
Yeah , I'd have to say it has . But I'm still paying for it , you know .
I know education is expensive , but it's been my lifelong dream . Call me crazy , but I've always wanted to have that PhD at the end of my name .
Well , getting a Doctorate degree would mean close to a decade of school . Can you afford that ? Can you survive that ?
I certainly can't afford it , but I'm sure I could find some good student loans .
I think you need to separate the dream of having a PhD from the reality of years of more schooling . It's not as romantic as you might think .
Yeah ... I keep thinking about what I'll do with a Master's or Doctorate . I love language but I don't think there are a lot of well-paying jobs out there for experts on Shakespeare .
Take it easy , honey . It's just raining cats and dogs .
But , dad , it's stormy outside .
Honey , it's just windy and raining outside .
What ’ s up ?
Well , actually I failed to meet a deadline last week and I forgot to answer an e-mail for a VIP customer yesterday .
Anything that distracts you from work ?
Yes , everything . I feel overwhelmed by the daily work . Sometimes , I just can ’ t focus on what I am doing . What is worse , though I make plans for a whole week , I always have to make changes later on because other things come up . I can ’ t manage my time well . I can ’ t handle work well . I am afraid I was screw up more things .
Look , Lucy . Things are not so bad as you said . This is our company ’ s busiest time in a year . You need to relax a little . Don ’ t push yourself too hard , ok ?
That's pretty advanced .
Now I'll quickly send a short message to my wife and take the elevator down to the basement .
Is that where you park ?
Yes , the car park is under constant video surveillance , so my car is quite safe . Please get in .
Thank you . Where is your key ?
There's no need , I have keyless entry , and the steering wheel recognizes my finger prints before starting the car . Now , we can look at the navigation system to find the best route home .
That's amazing , it even shows all the roads that are congested at the moment .
Using GPS I can rely on this to direct me home . Now I just need to find my E-Card to automatically open the gate and we can drive out .
Pretty soon cars will be driving themselves .
Maybe , but in the meantime why not help me find the remote control for my garage door ?
Here it is , and here we are .
When I turn off my home alarm , the house will automatically tum on the lights and set the climate to a comfortable level .
What happened ?
I'm still not sure about these ' Visible ' Certificates . What's the real difference , except the amounts available ?
Visible Certificates are registered and the holders of these can report any loss directly to the bank . Also , they can be cashed in advance , before the maturity is up .
Right . How about the Bearer Certificates ? Can they be cashed before the maturity date ?
Unfortunately , not . You see , because they are not registered , they can be bought and sold by anyone . They also can be cashed on maturity in any nationwide financial institution .
So , if I was strapped for cash , I could transfer it to get some money ?
Technically , yes .
How did you finally do it ?
A friend suggested that I stop nibbling between meals .
Like snacking ?
You know , a little piece of chocolate here , some chips on the side , candy now and then ...
I get what you mean .
Instead , I sit down and have a good snack like a piece of fruit between meals .
I'm going to do some jogging on the treadmill . Then I think I'll do some work with the dumbbless .
Good idea . I'd suggest you do some crunches too . Thery're great for getting in shape . Make sure you do them correctly .
Ok . I will . Could you help me with the treadmill ? I found it difficult to get the setting right last time .
Sure . Is today only you second visit ?
Yes , it is . I'll be coming here regularly . I think I need regular exercise to get in shape and then to stay in shape .
The treadmill is excellent for helping you to build up stamina . Each time you use it , increase this distance . don't worry about your speed at first . You can increase that later .
I was told that the first time I came heer . I was told not to put too much pressure on my body at first . I need to build up slowly .
Good morning ! Do you have any rooms available at the moment ?
Yes , we do . What kind of room would you like ?
I'd like a suite for four nights .
Please wait a moment while I check availability . Ah , I'm sorry , sir . We only have a double room available now .
That's all right . How much do they cost ?
Each night costs 320 RIB , but for a four night stay , we can offer a discount of 15 % .
How much in total ?
1088 RIB .
Is breakfast included ?
Yes , it is . You also have free use of the leisure facilities here .
That's fine . I'll get it .
OK . Please fill out this form with your details .
I would like to pay by cash . Do I need to pay a deposit ?
Yes , you do . There is a 300 RIB deposit , which we will refund when you check out . So , in total , you need to pay 1388 RIB .
Fine . Here you are .
Thank you . Here's your key and receipt . Your room number is 408 . A porter will take your luggage to your room . The elevator is just around the corner .
Thank you very much .
It is my pleasure , sir . I wish you a pleasant stay here . Goodbye !
There are 15 people in my family .
What did you say ? How many ?
15 people .
Wow . That is a very big family . Do you all live together ?
Of course we do ! My father's parents , Mum , Dad , three unmarried aunts , two uncles , my two brothers , my three sisters and me .
But you don't live at home anymore .
Right , but that's where my heart is . But you're right , now there are only 14 living at home .
My goodness ! Your family must live in a huge house .
Yes . My family lives in rural Korea , near Pusan . We have a huge house.The first floor of the house is a part-time private school.In the afternoon , students come for special tutoring in biology , Englis
Wow ! you grew up in a school ! No wonder your English is excellent !
My aunts and uncles are all teachers .
You are so lucky !
I guess so . While growing up , I read hundreds of interesting English storybooks every year .
That's what i did in America . I was reading all the time . I was never a big TV watcher . TV wastes time .
I agree . Reading for fun is why all the English students at our family school have excellent English . All the students read 800 easy storybooks during their second year of studying English .
800 books ? I'm impressed !
My mother is a professor and my father is a manager .
Do they often take you out ?
sure , thanks . I brought you a bottle of wine as well .
you're the first guest to arrive . I'll just put your coat away and then I'll get you something to drink .
should I take my shoes off ?
whatever you prefer .
this is a very nice place . How long have you been living here now ?
just over three weeks . Would you like a drink ?
sure , what do you have ?
I've got white wine , red wine , gin and tonics , ginger ale , lemonade , orange juice , and sprite .
I'll have a glass of red wine please .
one glass of red wine coming up !
so how many people are coming for the dinner tonight ?
there's just going to be 6 of us tonight .
oh , I thought there were going to be eight . who isn't coming ?
Marcia and Paul called to cancel at the last moment . Paul was running late and Marcia wasn't feeling well .
that's too bad.They ' re such good company .
I think there's someone at the door .
It'll be $ 65 for a monthly pass .
Is there anything cheaper than that ?
If you're in school , you can get a student pass .
Well , I am how much will that cost ?
The pass is free .
I don't have to pay for anything ?
You'll only have to pay for the monthly sticker .
How much is the monthly sticker ?
It's $ 24 for each month .
I'll take the student bus pass .
sorry , I'm afraid that I've got plans tonight .
what are you doing ?
I'm going to my parents ' house for my father's birthday .
how old is he today ?
it's his 50th birthday .
well , wish him a happy birthday for me .
sure thing . What are your plans for the evening ?
I was just thinking of going to a movie tonight .
well , if you can wait until tomorrow night , I'll go with you then .
sorry , I've got people coming over tomorrow night .
sounds like this weekend just isn't going to work out for us .
sounds that way . Maybe some other time then ?
sure.Hey , I'm sorry , but I've got to get going .
yeah , me , too . It's about time I made a move .
say hello to your friends for me .
likewise . See you later .
But I ’ Ve never been on a business trip before !
It ’ s easy enough . Just make sure you keep track of all your expenses . The accounting department will reimburse you for all your meals and travel expenses .
So the company will pay for everything ?
Yes , but when you send in your expense report , you also have to file a report summarizing your trip . It ’ s not just a big vacation , you know .
That sounds good . But what do you want me to do there ?
Yes , can I cash my traveler's check here ?
Of course , we'd be happy to cash it for you .
What's the cashing rate ?
Well , it's listed on the electronic board on the left . We cash it at present traveler's check buying rate .
Oh , I see . How much it the service charge ?
The service charge is 1 % of the total amount of the check .
Well , I'd like to cash these four checks for $ 100 each .
Would you please countersign them here ?
OK , there you are .
And your passport please .
Oh , I forgot to bring it . It is in my hotel room .
Sorry , sir . We can't cash the checks for you without your passport .
There ’ s a possibility . I ’ ll check it .
Thank you .
Sure , what's up ?
I have no idea where my class is .
Tell me which building it's in .
My class is in the C building .
I know where the C building is .
Do you mind telling me where it is ?
Of course , which room number is it ?
Number 261 .
I actually have a class right around there .
Can you please show me ?
Not everyone thinks Japan is beautiful , but to me its beauty is breathtaking.You feel the same way about France , don't you ?
Yes , I do feel the same way about France . The swift rivers , the fertile valleys , the large cities-its scenery is beautiful . Will you describe the geography of Japan ?
Well , it's made up of four large islands and many smaller islands located off the coast of the Asian main lands . France isn't an island , is it ?
Oh , no , France isn't an island . It is located in the western part of the European continent . But France does have many fine harbors and port cities on its southern and western coasts . Does Japan have good harbors ?
Good harbors ! Yokohama is one of the most famous port cities in the world , and Japan is the largest shipbuilding nation in the world . Also , there are long mountain ranges in the southern is hands . France isn't very mountainous , is it ?
No , France isn't very mountainous . But it does contain the Pyrenees , a large mountain range with high peaks and deep canyons . What kind of Climate does Japan have ?
The Japanese climate is warm and moist in the south , mild in the central part and cold in the north . Except for Hokkaido , we don't get much snowfall at all . France has a mild climate , doesn't it ?
Yes , the climate of France rarely has severe winters . In southern France , one can live in comfort the whole year . Is Japan good for farming ?
Yes , Japan is good for farming . Rice is the main crop , but Japan is also an industrial center . Fishing is very important , too . Rice isn't grown in France , is it ?
No , rice isn't grown in France . But farming , fishing and industry are also very important in France . I'd like to go to Japan some day . Would you like to visit France ?
Thank you . I'll go through it and tell you .
We hope you get on board with us , Please let me know as soon as possible .
How long have you been feeling this way ?
It all started the day before yesterday .
You seem to have picked up some kind of infection .
What should I do ?
That's fine . Don't forget to update the inventory .
Sorry , what do you mean ?
Just a second and I'll check the schedule .
I'll need an economy ticket with an open return .
American Airlines has a flight leaving at 9:25 a . m .
I guess that's OK . What time should I check in ?
Calm down . Madam .
I'm about to explode ! You ’ Ve made a mess of this matter .
I am very sorry to hear that you ’ Ve been having so many problems .
Sorry isn ’ t good enough ! What can you do to help me ?
I understand why you ’ re angry , Mrs . Wilson , and believe me , we are doing everything in our power to work this out .
Well , obviously , what you ’ re doing is not good enough !
I really didn't mean to .
It doesn't matter , because you damaged my car .
It looks okay to me .
Look what you did to my rear bumper .
What's wrong with it ?
My bumper is smashed in .
I didn't do that .
Your front bumper is just as damaged .
If you'd just give me your number and insurance , then I'll handle it .
Here . I'd better get a call from you .
You just don't get it . Looking for bargains can be really interesting .
Are you serious ? How can that be ?
Bargaining is a game , or even a battle . You feel like a winner when you get a good price .
Come on . You know , you can never really win . The salesperson never loses . They make their living out of it .
That's true . But I just love it . Come here !
Oh , this silk carpet is really beautiful . Look at the pattern , and how delicate it is !
You do have great taste . That's the most expensive stuff here .
Really ? Oh , this one . I like the cloisonn vase .
Are you kidding me ? I bought a same one last week . It's surprising that there is something we both like . Well , what do you think of these ceramic cups ?
Come on . They look so cheap . Something else , please .
What about this picture ? I think Benjamin would like it .
Don't underestimate his taste . I don't think he'd like it .
Don't be so sure . He loves the vase I bought here last week .
Yeah . Well , anyway , it's up to you . But I can tell that you come here often .
Yes , I do . But my characters are very bad .
It takes a long time to learn Chinese writing .
Are you Chinese ?
Yes , I am . I am from Taiwan . I came here to study political science .
How do you like it ?
I like it so far . But my English still needs work .
I want to study Mandarin and international relations .
Does the Chinese department here teach regular characters or simplified characters ?
They teach regular characters .
I see . I'm from Taiwan , so I know regular characters better than simplified .
You just said your English needs work , yes ?
Yes , that's true . Especially my writing . I think my papers aren't good enough . I make too many grammatical mistakes .
Well , I am very serious about learning Chinese.But for me the hard part now is pronunciation.You have the four tones in Chinese . It is very hard . Maybe , if you have time , maybe we could do a language exchange .
You mean you and I ?
Yes , why not ? I mean , if you come to this cafe often , maybe we could meet here and practice Chinese and English .
That sounds like a good idea . How often would you like to do it ?
Let's see ... My schedule right now is quite busy.But I think I could spend 90 minutes a week in language exchange .
How would we manage it though ? How would we spend the 90 minutes ?
First , we could spend 45 minutes working on your English writing.If you want , I could help you edit your papers.Or we could do English conversation . Whatever you want.And then the next 45 minutes you would help me with my Chinese .
Would I help you with writing ?
No . For me right now , the important thing is spoken Chinese . I need practice . So you could tutor me in speaking.We could use my textbook , and you could ask me questions.Then you could correct my mistakes .
I think it sounds like a good system . But when is it convenient to meet ?
Well , today is Monday.Actually , for me Monday at this time would be the best . I am free from now until 11
Me too . In fact , I'm free until 1
So if you want to meet at 10
It sounds good . I will bring the papers I'm working on .
And I will bring my textbook and a tape recorder . I would like to record some things so I can practice on my own .
Let me give you my phone number .
Thank you for returning my call .
What was your call about ?
I wanted to have a talk with you about your son .
What did he do ?
He was messing around last week in class .
Exactly what did he do ?
Even though I asked him not to , he kept speaking out in class .
I don't know what his problem is .
I need you to talk to him , if you don't mind .
That won't happen again , I'm sorry .
Yes . I am going to have a summer vacation . Would you recommend some scenic spots to see ?
Which place are you most interested in ?
Maybe Europe .
Well , I strongly suggest you going to London . It's really charming .
Certainly . Here it is .
You are here on business , I think ?
That's right . A German company has invited me for business talks .
How long will you be staying ?
Just two weeks .
How many pieces of baggage have you got ?
Only one . In this case , I have a camera .
Do you intend to take it out on your departure ?
Yes , I do .
According to the regulations , the camera you've brought along for personal use can be passed for the time being duty free , but you will have to take it out with you when you leave the country .
I will .
Well . Have a pleasant stay in Germany .
To start with I would like something part time with the hope that it can develop into something full time .
So you are interested in being with a company for the long term ?
Yes , that's right . I like this city very much and would like to make my home here .
Here is an application . Please fill it out to the best of your ability . Did you bring a resume and references ?
Yes , I did . I have them here .
Keep them until you ready to give me the application and you can turn them all in at once .
I think Pond's is the best .
And they're very dear , too .
They're on special offer today .
Well , black is a better color than pink . Pink ’ s for girls .
Then why are you wearing black shoes ?
Because ... oh , all right . You win . Let ’ s pay for them and go .
Oh , this ? I got it in Singapore . Here , do you want to take a look ?
Thanks . Gee , it's really light !
Yes , it is , isn't it ? A bit too light , really . What make have you got ?
I've got an old Ericsson . Here . Take a look .
Wow , that's really old .
Yes , I like collecting antiques .
Why don't you get a new one ?
I don't know . I like this one , and I don't have any need for all the bells and whistles you get on the new ones .
Really , what makes you say that ?
Well , I just need to make and receive calls , and it's quite reliable . I find that the more fancy stuff they put into these things , the more likely they are to break bown or go wrong , you know ? I mean , this camera function , for instance-how often do you use it ?
Sometimes , but I guess not very often . It's more for fun . Sometimes when I'm on a trip , for example , I can take a picture and send it to my kids . Or I can send a picture of a sample back to my office and get it costed up immediately .
Well , that's nice I guess . So how many kids do you have ?
We still have to do about ten more .
Well . I am really tired from packing all of the stuff all day . And it's about time to clock out .
I know . Maybe we can finish it tomorrow .
Why not ! These orders are not urgent . We could do it first thing tomorrow morning
All right . Let's call it quits and go home .
Can ’ t complain . And you ?
Business is booming . I understand you want to meet up with me next week . How ’ s your schedule looking ?
Let me see . I can come out and see you first thing Wednesday .
Leftovers .
What ? Leftovers of what and from when ?
From last night ! I took the left over turkey , mixed it with some diced peppers and onions , added a little bit of mayonnaise and made some sandwiches !
Isn't that dangerous though ? I mean bacteria and germs reproducing on food that was left out or re-heated ?
Well , I didn't leave the turkey out at room temperature for more than a an hour and I refrigerated it soon after we finished eating . Also , when reheating , I put it in the oven for fifteen minutes at one hundred degrees Celsius .
Well OK , I am just afraid of getting food poisoning .
Yes . I like gardening .
Oh , that's interesting . Do you have a garden ?
Yes , follow me . Here it is .
Your garden is really lovely .
Thank you .
Do you take care of them everyday ?
Yes , I do .
Don't you feel dull ?
No , I ’ d like to know something about contact lenses .
Oh , I see . We have both hard and soft contact lenses . They are very popular , but a little more expensive than ordinary glasses .
I have found I ’ m short-sighted recently . I need to wear glasses . As a student , it ’ s better for me to wear ordinary glasses instead of contact lenses .
We have many kinds of glasses here . Which frames do you like best ?
I think the square-shaped ones will be the best for me .
What about this pair ? They are the ' in ' things now in optical wear . Try them on .
They fit me very well . I like them .
Good idea . There is a good nightclub nearby , isn't it ?
Yes , the dance hall is nice with various styles of music .
( In the club ) Look at those people in the dance floor , they are so crazy .
That's rock and roll with fast tempo .
I like the slow dance . I am good at rumba and waltz .
Take it easy . The time for slow dance is the middle part of the party .
Let's find a quiet seat and sit down for beverage .
OK , follow me .
Listen , it is waltz . I like the elegant step of the old styles .
May I ?
Sure .
I want to book a tour with adventure sports .
Excellent ! Our company has more than ten years of experience in the adventure tourism and sports field . Let me show you some options . This is our most popular choice , our river guides will take you
I don ’ t really think I ’ m ready to throw myself down a river full of jagged rocks in a rubber boat or go up in the air in a wicker basket held up by an oversize balloon . What else do you have ?

Hello , Kristy . Could I speak to the department that deals with credit card applications , please ?
I can deal with that , Sir . Are you interested in our personal or corporate card ?

That's no problem . How long will the whole thing take ? A week ? 10 days ?
It should all be sorted out within 5 working days after receipt of the required documents .
But to me it's really enjoyable .
Maybe it's because you always have pretty girls as your partners .
Hello , John .
I'm with Hartford public relations . I'd like to set up an appointment to come by and talk with you about our services .
I don't know .
I can help you with that . Do you still have your receipt ?
No , I receive this as a birthday present , but the price tag is still on the skirt though . Will that be OK ?
Oh , yes , that will help me a lot .
Do you have any more skirts in this style ? I would like to find a size larger .
I'm sorry . I think we're out of this skirt in this color . Do you want me to call another one of our store to see if it's available there ?
No , that's all right . I'll just look for something else .
You've done a lot , my darling !
I may have done a lot , but none is to my satisfaction .
You're too strict with yourself .
Those tow games are quite different . First , there ’ s the size of the teams . In football , a team has 11 players . In rugby there are 15 players on each team . The biggest difference is that in football , only the goalkeeper can use his hands . In rugby , the ball is usually carried forward by players , though kicking is permitted .
In rugby , players pass the ball by throwing it to team mates , don ’ t they ?
That ’ s right . However , players can only pass the ball backwards . They cannot pass the ball forwards to their team mates . That ’ s a foul .
I know how goals are scored in football , but how about in rugby ?
If a team carries the ball over the goal line , they score points . A team can also score points by kicking the ball between two tall posts at each end of the pitch .
There ’ s a lot more physical contact in rugby , isn ’ t there ?
Yes . Players usually need to bring a player down to stop him from moving forward with the ball . This is called ” tackling ” , as in football .
The ball is a different shape in rugby , isn ’ t it ?
Yes . It ’ s not perfectly round like a football . A rugby ball is oval in shape . There ’ s a match on TV this afternoon . Why don ’ t you watch it with me ? I ’ ll try to explain the rules and tactics while we ’ re watching .
Good afternoon . I have a reservation under the name of Hilton .
Could you spell that , please ?
Sure . It's H-I-L-T-O-N .
One moment , please . Ah yes , Mr . Hilton , you booked a single room for three nights . Is that correct ?
Yes , that's right .
I see from the computer that you are a frequent guest here . Do you have your loyalty card ?
Yes , here you are . And here's my credit card , too .
Thank you . Right , your room number is 105 . Here's your key and receipt . Thank you for choosing our hotel again , sir .
Thank you , goodbye .
No , I don't want to .
Really . The special effects are fantastic.You shouldn't be scared . You would really enjoy it .
Sam , I never like Haunted Houses.When I was a kid , I didn't like them . when I was in high school , I didn't like them.when I was in college , I didn't like them . So why should I like them now ?
But this is maybe one of the best Haunted Houses in North America ! It's different .
Why don't we go to the Epcot Center instead ? They have displays from many cultures around the world .
I saw that in the guide.It looks like they have different restaurants and different kinds of architecture.Do you want to go ?
Yes . That is something I will enjoy .
Alright , let's go then . How many tickets do we have left ?
We still have most of the tickets we bought.We can go on a lot of different rides if you like .
I was only interested in the Haunted House and the roller coaster rides.The other rides are for kids .
Let's start walking to the Epcot Center then.According to this map , it is up this pathway here .
Oh , why not ?
It ’ s just I ’ m not feeling well . I think I ’ m coming down with a cold or something .
Oh , I ’ m sorry to hear that . Hey , don ’ t worry about the dinner . We ’ ll do it some other time . But you take care of yourself .
Well , he ’ s really lucky . It seems that he could win the bet at every turn .
But I don ’ t envy those who are filthy with dough . That ’ s not the whole life .
